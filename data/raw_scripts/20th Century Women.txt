She looks vulnerable. DOROTHEA That was a beautiful car. JAMIE Mom, it smelled like gas and overheated all the time, and it was just old... Dorothea's surprised, she didn't know they felt so differently about the car. DOROTHEA (What?) Well it wasn't always old. Dorothea goes to touch his hair. He bends away from her hand. Jamie turns to his mom, trying to explain the contemporary world to her. JAMIE You know, when the firemen come, people don't usually invite them over for dinner.

People are all talking and drinking, eating and moving around the room. WE CROSS BETWEEN MANY SHORT INTERWOVEN MOMENTS WITHIN THE PARTY. CAMERA MOVES WITH Dorothea showing the FIRE CHIEF a little of the house. William silently glides with them. DOROTHEA It was built in 1905, the same family had it forever, but they lost all their money during the war, there was a fire - you should've been here for that. Anyway, so it was just a mess, they just let it fall apart. Then a bohemian inherited it in the 60's, bunch of free spirits lived here, and they lost it to the bank. FIRE CHIEF It's beautiful.
C: DOROTHEA
D: I completely fell in love with it. CAMERA FINDS WILLIAM AND ABBIE, sitting on the couch talking.
E: I think so
C: WILLIAM

She nods awkwardly to the beat, trying to relate. DOROTHEA Can't things just be pretty? JAMIE "Pretty" music's used to hide how unfair and corrupt society is. DOROTHEA Ah, okay so... they're not very good, and they know that, right? He just looks at her - `why're you still here' - she looks at him confused by his pushing her away. Seriously curious. ABBIE Yea, it's like they've got this feeling, and they don't have any skill, and they don't want skill, because it's really interesting what happens when your passion is bigger than the tools you have to deal with it.

The girls watch nurses take off his shirt, put on EKG nodes, his body is limp, Abbie starts to silently cry, Julie too? Dorothea finds Jamie's screened in area. William sits politely outside. His concern is for Dorothea. NOW Behind the screen, DOROTHEA FREEZES when she sees the wires all over his bare chest. Abbie and Julie are squished into a corner. Dorothea moves around the nurses and technicians still working, she finds his hand, puts it in both of hers, presses her forehead against it.

S: INT. DOROTHEA'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Hard cut to Dorothea working on the house late at night. William sees Dorothea down the hall, working away, hard on herself. She looks up and sees him. Why is it easy for her to be vulnerable with William? DOROTHEA Maybe I did do the wrong thing? WILLIAM Jamie's energy's very unstable, I think that's why he does all this. DOROTHEA Well there's an energy crisis, that must be playing into it. He just looks at her sincerely, why joke? DOROTHEA You don't have a lot of funny lines do you? He doesn't react. She leaves the room, seemingly fine.

Maybe just shoot all my stuff, everything I own, or everything that's important to me. A portrait of myself through all the objects I own? Can I show you? WILLIAM Yeah? She lays out polaroids for him to see. ABBIE Bra, birth control, "On Photography" by Susan Sontag, my shoes, underwear, a picture of a picture of my mom... I'm gonna do a bunch of them. He looks through some of her test Polaroids. Sort of immediately engrossed. WILLIAM It's sad in a way isn't it? All this stuff? You know what I mean? She didn't expect him to get it. She's looking at one of her objects as she talks. Longer eye contact than usual. He sits, looks at her, his hand is next to her hand. Something's going on for her, takes a beat to say it. ABBIE You want to fool around, with me? WILLIAM Really? Yeah. He touches her hair. She closes her eyes, melts more than she thought she would, just to be wanted is nice. She never tells people about her cancer. ABBIE (CONT'D) You know I'm recovering from cervical cancer? WILLIAM I know. She can't believe he still wants to fool around. Everyone else treats her like a leper. Takes her a beat to assess what she feels capable of. He kisses her. She smells his hair. ABBIE (CONT'D) Your hair smells good. WILLIAM I make my own shampoo. ABBIE Of course you do. How did she get so far off course? She closes her eyes and kisses him again.

S: INT. WILLIAM'S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Abbie and William are kissing, shirts off, she pulls back, stops. Looks at him strange. ABBIE I'm gonna need a story. WILLIAM A what? ABBIE (CONT'D) A story, like, you're a photographer taking pictures of me, I'm like a very normal woman or something, you have to photograph me, but you can't control yourself and you start touching me, and you shouldn't, but you can't stop and you keep apologizing, `I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...' WILLIAM Can't I just be me? ABBIE No... sorry. This isn't William's usual comfort zone, not his trip. But something about Abbie's strength has him. CUT TO: William stands beside the bed, pretending to be her photographer. He wants to play her game, doesn't really know how. ABBIE Okay, so do I just? WILLIAM Hey, nice to meet you. They shake hands. ABBIE Oh, Hi. Do I just look in the camera, or should I look off to the side? WILLIAM Let's start that way, looking in the camera. ABBIE Okay, should I smile? WILLIAM Do you like to smile? ABBIE Yeah. WILLIAM Okay. He pretends to take a picture. ABBIE Oh, you took it. I thought you would say like 1, 2, 3... WILLIAM No, I just wait for the moment. ABBIE Okay. WILLIAM (CONT'D) I just have to fix something. He leans in and fixes her bra strap. She melts. WILLIAM Sorry. ABBIE Oh, no, it's fine. I've just never done this before so I'm a little bit nervous. But I can wear my hair differently if you want. WILLIAM Abbie. ABBIE Yeah? He breaks their role playing and talks to her sincerely.

A reflective beat, they say goodbye and Julie gets out of the car. Dorothea drives off, more unnerved than she expected. INT. DOROTHEA'S HOUSE - DAY Dorothea re-enters. Jamie's finishing the stocks - surprising Dorothea a little.
C: JAMIE
D: Where were you? He's been lying to her, so why would she tell him the truth?
C: DOROTHEA
D: I had some errands... You did the whole list? You know all the stocks?
C: JAMIE
D: Yeah. That means a lot to her. She's processing their life together a bit. William's watching them.
C: DOROTHEA
D: IBM's down again huh? Jamie leaves. Dorothea watches him go down the hall. She lights up. Observes William.
C: DOROTHEA
D: William?
C: WILLIAM
D: Yes?
C: DOROTHEA
D: Do I seem, stuck, to you?
C: WILLIAM
D: How do you mean?
C: DOROTHEA
D: I guess I wouldn't know would I? Abbie enters, awkwardly avoiding William, he's not used to being treated that way. Dorothea clocks all of this, amused, bit of a trouble maker.
C: DOROTHEA
D: Let's go out tonight? I'd like to see this modern world. On Abbie's surprise.
C: WILLIAM
D: Can I come? INT. BAUDELAIRES - NIGHT Abbie leads Dorothea and William into the grungy, graffiti-lined club filled with Santa Barbara's punks. A local post-punk band blares from the stage. Dorothea would never appear intimidated, but this is a strange and loud new world for her. William too. Dorothea and William get a drink at the bar.
C: DOROTHEA
D: I don't know if I'm going to find an appropriate man here.
C: WILLIAM
D: You might. He's looking right at her. He touches her hand on the bar, she looks at his hand like it's a foreign object.
C: DOROTHEA
D: Hello - He leans in and gently kisses her on the lips, hoping she will get him out of the traps he's made. She seems completely unstirred.
C: DOROTHEA
D: What was that? What does that mean?
C: WILLIAM DOROTHEA
D: Don't just kiss a woman if you don't have some idea what you mean by it.
C: WILLIAM DOROTHEA
D: Aren't you sleeping with Abbie?
C: WILLIAM
D: It's nothing serious.
C: DOROTHEA
D: Then why do it?
N: She turns away from him coldly, but we see the kiss affected her. A band begins to play, a distorted WALL OF SOUND. Kids head toward the stage, some begin to dance. Dorothea walks through the crowd, curious about this world. Dorothea makes her way to the front, into the sea of noise and strobe light. William watches, impressed by Dorothea's willingness. CLOSE ON Dorothea, strobe lit, her expressions searching for hope and meaning in this music, as her face goes ON...OFF... ON...OFF the music cross fades to score. DOROTHEA (V.O.) It's 1979. I'm 55 years old. This is what my son believes in. WE SEE: The band playing on stage. CUT TO: REPORTAGE OF DIFFERENT 1979 PUNK PERFORMERS ON STAGE. THEIR CHARISMA, THEIR ABANDON, THAT'S WHAT WE SEE.

C: WILLIAM
D: You're going?
C: DOROTHEA
D: Yeah. Do me a favor, stay here, take care of Abbie. She points him to Abbie, begins to head out, turns back and looks at the 79 punks and the band in the distance.
C: DOROTHEA V.O. VISUALS

S: EXT. BAUDELAIRES
N: Dorothea exits, disturbed. Julian the doorman is there.
C: DOROTHEA

C: DOROTHEA
D: Thanks.
C: JULIAN
D: Did you have a good time?
C: DOROTHEA
D: Yeah, it was interesting. She leaves, we follow her walking home, struggling inside.
C: DOROTHEA
D: Abbie's got your number? Maybe you can come over for dinner some night? INT. DOROTHEA'S HOUSE - NIGHT Dorothea enters, lost in her thoughts, walks through the rooms. Jamie's half asleep, watching TV in the living room, half waiting up for her, a role reversal.
C: JAMIE
D: It's late. A strange, aloof look.
C: JAMIE
D: How was it?
C: DOROTHEA
D: Life changing. She smiles through her lost feelings and walks off. INT. DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Dorothea smokes, pets Jeeves, thinks. CLOSE ON the smoke slowly rising into the air.
C: DOROTHEA
D: Before I die I will prepare for Y2K. Canned food and water in the garage. I put 16 thousand dollars worth of gold coins into a safe deposit box at the Bank of Montecito. I died before the new year, Dolphin shaped balloons floated over my head, they were playing Louis Armstrong on a boom box. LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S "BASIN STREET BLUES" PLAYS INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT Abbie stumbles in with a busted lip, disgusted with her night. She doesn't know what to do, then decides to go up to Jamie's room. INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT There's a KNOCK. Julie hides under the covers.

C: ABBIE
D: I'm sorry, you awake?
C: JAMIE
D: Yeah.
C: ABBIE
D: I wanted to tell you, you just have to get out of this town, If you want to have any chance at an interesting life where you can move forward.
C: JAMIE
D: What happened? She sees Julie.
E: CONT'D
C: ABBIE
D: Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
C: JULIE
D: We don't have sex. I just sleep here. She looks at Jamie for verification, he nods, `sad but true'.
C: JAMIE
D: What happened?
C: ABBIE
D: Can I lay down?
C: JAMIE
D: Yeah, here, lay down. He makes room, Julie's pissed. Half just to not be bossed around by Julie, Abbie lays down. Jamie's surrounded by two of the women he loves.
C: JULIE
D: We were sleeping.
C: ABBIE
D: I'm talking to Jamie for a sec, OK? She composes herself on the bed,
C: ABBIE CONTD

E: V.O.
C: ABBIE
D: Because I spit on her. TO ABBIE'S SURPRISE LYNETTE LUNGES BACK AT ABBIE, KNOCKING HER TO THE FLOOR, STRADDLING HER, HITTING HER.
E: V.O.
C: ABBIE V.O.
D: Right before I was going to New York and I thought I was never coming back. It felt very liberating at the time. WILLIAM FINALLY PULLS OFF LYNETTE - ABBIE, BLOODY LIP OR NOSE, IS ENRAGED AT EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED TO HER, GRABS A CHAIR AND AWKWARDLY TRIES TO DESTROY IT AGAINST THE GROUND, OVER AND OVER.
N: ABBIE V.O. And somehow I ended up breaking a chair.
S: EXT. BAUDELAIRES - NIGHT
N: Abbie quickly exits, bloody lip, torn up shirt. She rushes past Julian, "Hey, what happened?" She's running down the street. It takes a block for William to catch up to her, he has to pull her to a stop. He has something to tell her.
C: ABBIE
D: And then William told me he didn't want to sleep with me anymore. Not that I ever really wanted to sleep with him. She yells at William.
E: V.O.
C: ABBIE
D: What are you saying? I don't like you, I don't like you, I don't like you, I don't like you. BACK IN JAMIE'S BEDROOM: Abbie changes her mood again. Abbie gestures for Julie to look away.
C: ABBIE
D: I'm just gonna talk to Jamie for a second. Set gets very close to him, almost sexual.
E: To Julie
C: ABBIE
D: Don't let her sleep here without having sex with you, it's disempowering. And get out of this town before you end up working in a sunglasses shop. She looks at Julie.
E: CONT'D
C: ABBIE
D: That goes for you too. And with that she gets up and leaves. Julie's jealous. INT. DOROTHEA'S BREAKFAST TABLE Julie, Jamie, Dorothea and William eat breakfast. Abbie shows up with a busted lip. Dorothea's curious - Abbie waves her off and glares at William. Abbie has some books for Jamie.
C: ABBIE
D: Here's some books from my feminism class. I thought they might be good for you, a woman's perspective.
C: JAMIE
D: Thanks.
C: DOROTHEA
D: What happened to your lip?
C: ABBIE
D: There was a fight.
C: DOROTHEA
D: What?
C: ABBIE
D: It was ridiculous.
N: William picks up "Our Bodies Our Selves".
C: WILLIAM
D: I read this. The chapter on home birth. It was pretty helpful. He digs into it, he's a mystery to them. Does he read something aloud?
C: JULIE
D: Home births actually stunts the baby's growth personality.
C: ABBIE
D: What is a growth personality?
C: JAMIE
D: It's a real term.
C: WILLIAM
D: "And who knows what it means for a newborn to see wood walls and carpeted floors and to smell real human smells and to feel wool and cotton and flannel clothes instead of starchy, white, deodorized..." to me, that meant, what else? Dorothea looks on, perplexed, what is this world? INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Jamie in bed looks through the book SISTERHOOD IS POWERFUL.

C: MATT
D: I fucked Heather so hard, she came like three times.
C: JAMIE
D: How did you stimulate her clitoris? What?
C: MATT
D: With my dick.
C: JAMIE
D: Women need direct clitoral stimulation, with fingers or a vibrator or something. She probably faked it, women fake it all the time. All the boys feel betrayed on a deep level. Matt focuses on Jamie's TALKING HEADS 77 shirt.
C: MATT
D: Talking Heads're a bunch of fags.
C: JAMIE
D: There's a girl in the band and she goes out with the drummer, so... CUT TO: Jamie and Matt FIGHTING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RAMP. Matt is stronger, he rubs Jamie's face in the dirt. EXT.

C: JAMIE
D: I want to be a good guy. She's lost.
C: JAMIE
D: I want to be able to satisfy a woman.
C: DOROTHEA
D: I'm sure you will. She exits. EXT. DOROTHEA'S HOUSE - MORNING Dorothea's on her way to work. "ART FAG" is spray painted on one side of her car. "BLACK FLAG" on the other side.
N: DOROTHEA Jesus. CUT TO: Dorothea drags Jamie, Abbie and William out. JAMIE That's what Matt called me. Cause I like the Talking Heads. Dorothea lashes out at Jamie and Abbie. DOROTHEA What's Black Flag? ABBIE They're a hardcore band, people who like them hate the Talking Heads. DOROTHEA What? ABBIE The punk scene's very divisive. DOROTHEA You all're so advanced, aren't you? She gets in the car and heads out.
S: INT. ABBIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Abbie's taking Jamie's portrait. ABBIE When dudes tell you their sex stories, don't contradict them, trust me, just go with their fantasy of what happened. Jamie laughs. Abbie smiles, but is sad underneath. JAMIE How are you holding up with everything? ABBIE You're very sweet to me. She plops back on her bed. Referring to everything that's happened to her. ABBIE (CONT'D) Whatever you think your life is going to be like, just know, it's not going to be anything like that. JAMIE Right. She smiles at his attempt to be her equal. JAMIE (CONT'D) Take me to that club.

S: INT. BAUDELAIRES CLUB - NIGHT
N: Abbie and Jamie walk through the club, dingy, graffiti, bare bulbs. Jamie's enthralled. Abbie takes a sip of beer, pushes it to Jamie, he gulps. She watches him take all this in, so young and alive, it makes her feel good to be helping him. CUT TO: Abbie and Jamie standing in the crowd with TRISH (Abbie's punk friend). Abbie whispers in his ear, he repeats.
C: JAMIE
D: I'm into older women.
C: TRISH
D: Oh? How old are you? Abbie whispers, he repeats.
C: JAMIE
D: Age is a bourgeois construct.
C: TRISH
D: Good answer.
C: JAMIE ABBIE
D: Age is a bourgeois construct. OK, OK.
N: All in front of Trish...
C: ABBIE
D: If she asks any questions, just say as little as you can. Let me see your most inscrutable face. He kind of makes one. CLOSE ON Jamie and Trish on the dance floor, punk music blaring. Abbie has found a moment of freedom. INT. DOROTHEA'S HOUSE - NIGHT William and Dorothea sit at the kitchen table, drinking a beer after working on the house.

C: DOROTHEA
D: He didn't turn out like I thought he would.
C: WILLIAM
D: Must've been something good about him. She stops and thinks.
C: DOROTHEA
D: He was left handed. She acts it out.
C: DOROTHEA
D: I'm right handed, so in the morning, we could go through the stock reports together, he could write with his left hand and scratch my back with his right.
C: WILLIAM
D: That's it?
C: DOROTHEA
D: I liked that. She slips into memory, looks sad, goes back to work. He pulls the plug on her sander.
C: WILLIAM
D: You ever meditate? INT. WILLIAM'S ROOM - NIGHT He's sitting on the edge of his bed, eyes closed. Dorothea's in a chair across from him, sneaking peeks at him. There is something calming about it, and his strange little room with his pottery in it. She finds her cigarettes, lights up. The sound wakes him up, she mimes `keep going, I'm fine, I'm just gonna smoke while I meditate.' William laughs, enjoys her humor, they share a look. He smiles at her.
C: DOROTHEA
D: You're such an odd bird sweetie. How'd you get like that anyways? TITLE: WILLIAM SAUNDERS BORN 1939 EXT. WILLIAM'S CAR AREA William works on a car - he does not love this work.

S: EXT. SANTA BARBARA STREETS - NIGHT
N: They cruise in the old Ford.
S: INT. MEL'S BAR - NIGHT
N: Dorothea at the juke box, she selects an old GENE AUSTIN song. She sways alone on the empty dance floor. William appears and dances, fluid hippie style. She looks at him in disbelief. DOROTHEA My, dear. How can you learn about a person over there? He stops, OK, how do you do it? DOROTHEA First, you introduce yourself to her, a little small talk, then you ask her to dance. WILLIAM I'm William, I live downstairs, with all the cars. DOROTHEA Hello William. WILLIAM Would you like to dance? She reaches out and takes his hand, awkwardly pulls him in.
C: DOROTHEA
D: This hand goes here, this one round here. And just, be with her, all she really wants is some company. CLOSE ON William, it's still mysterious what he feels, but he's definitely happy. They dance to Gene Austin. CLOSE ON Dorothea, the contact, the dancing affects her more than she planned. 40's music is taken over by DAVID BOWIE'S 1979 SONG "DJ" INT. BAUDELAIRES - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS BOWIE'S "DJ" BLARES: Jamie, Trish, Abbie and some older guys dance to chaotic, intense music. CLOSE ON ABBIE: feeling some of the freedom she's been missing, some of the liberation this world used to give her. EXT. AROUND BANDSHELL PARK - NIGHT Everyone piles out of the car, running across the empty dark park. Abbie lays down in the wet grass. Jamie comes over, trying to make her feel better.
C: JAMIE
D: I understand you. We should go away, just you and me, get up the coast, be alone somewhere.
C: ABBIE
D: Hey - Jamie. You're in love with Julie. Don't let her just run over you. Tell her what you want.
C: JAMIE
D: I know. But he's heartbroken for Abbie. They share a look of love and regret. She touches him sweetly, somehow older than she was an hour ago, more alive to how complicated it all is. She punches him in slow motion. INT. DOROTHEA'S ENTRY WAY Dorothea and William return home from the bar. Having passed the "Art Fag" car on the way in, they discuss.
C: DOROTHEA
D: If you were to listen to it, what does that mean, "Art Fag"? What is, think about it, from more like a sociological prospective. What is that?
C: WILLIAM
D: Abbie understands it.
C: DOROTHEA
D: Abbie does not understand it, she's just a part of it. INT. ABBIE'S ROOM - NIGHT Dorothea and William find the BLACK FLAG record. Dorothea puts NERVOUS BREAKDOWN on the turntable. They jolt with the first guitar blast. Dorothea's trying to understand it. William doesn't get her efforts, he takes the needle off.
C: WILLIAM
D: We don't need to like this. Dorothea needs to know why this works, she puts the needle back on, the music starts up again.
C: DOROTHEA
D: What's he saying? With love, William talks them out.
C: WILLIAM
D: `Head on my shoulders, it's going berserk.'
C: DOROTHEA
D: Is that interesting?
C: WILLIAM
D: I don't know either Dorothea. He takes her hand, stands her up.
C: WILLIAM
D: Maybe we're over thinking it. CUT TO: The MUSIC's LOUDER. William and Dorothea dance hesitatingly, sort of a light mosh, awkward. They slowly stop.
N: DOROTHEA What about the other one? The art fag one? CUT TO: William and Dorothea listening to TALKING HEADS "THE BIG COUNTRY." The music is odd, but spacious. William does a more fluid, semi-hippie dance. Dorothea does an imitation of him, half mocking him. He smiles. DOROTHEA I guess we're more art fag types. They continue to dance, free, awkward, filled with life.
S: EXT. SANTA BARBARA STREET - NIGHT
N: Jamie, Abbie and the others make their way down the beach, lit only by Abbie's flashes. They're drinking, rowdy. Trish has her arm around Jamie. CUT TO: Trish and Jamie are away from the group. Her cut-up T-shirt reveals her cleavage, Jamie can't help but notice. TRISH What're you looking at - inscrutable boy. She kisses him and then pushes him away. Abbie's seen this happen with very mixed feelings. They all run down the beach at night. ABBIE (V.O.) PRELAP I gave him beer, taught him how to verbally seduce women, we drove drunk, but I stopped that, and then he kissed Trish? Then we walked home.
T: CUT TO: ABBIE'S BEDROOM
N: Abbie's talking to Dorothea in her room. Looking guilty. Dorothea cringes in motherly fear, but this is what she wanted. DOROTHEA Ah. Is he OK? To Abbie's surprise. ABBIE You're not mad? You're mad. You should be mad. It's not that - Dorothea's processing a lot. DOROTHEA (CONT'D) You get to see him out in the world as a person, I never will. Abbie feels for Dorothea. She hands him one of the Polaroids from the night, Jamie looking wild eyed, having fun. ABBIE There, there he is. Dorothea looks at the stranger in the picture.
S: INT. DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Dorothea lays in bed, worrying.
S: EXT. EUCALYPTUS AREA - DAY
N: Julie and Jamie are alone. Reading. Julie with "Forever" and Jamie with "Our Bodies Our Selves." Julie looks to him. Critical. Takes the book from him. JULIE I can't believe that Abbie gave you this. He looks at it with her. JAMIE It's interesting. He takes it back. Reads a little more. JAMIE (CONT'D) What's it like, for girls? She looks to him.
C: JULIE
D: What, sex?
C: JAMIE
D: Orgasms. She rolls her eyes. She goes back to reading. So does he.
C: JULIE
D: You really want to know?
C: JAMIE
D: Yeah.
C: JULIE
D: I don't have them. None of my friends do.
C: JAMIE
D: What? Why do you do it?
C: JULIE
D: There's other reasons. The way they look at me, the way they all get a little desperate at some point. The little sounds they make. She begins to imitate the sexual grunts of one of her guys.

E: V.O.
S: INT. DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: Jamie's reading SISTERHOOD IS POWERFUL to Dorothea - she's interested, but truly uncomfortable with all that she's heard. We set up him reading to her, then do a long track in on her face as she hears all this.
C: JAMIE
D: I have a capacity now for taking people as they are, which I lacked at twenty; I reach orgasm in half the time and I know how to please. Yet I do not even dare show a man that I find him attractive. If I do so, he may react as if I had insulted him. I am supposed to fulfill my small functions and vanish. He's feeling for her and trying to connect with her situation. He stops, long pause.
C: DOROTHEA
D: What do you think of all that?
C: JAMIE
D: Maybe, I'm a feminist?
C: DOROTHEA
D: That's easy for men to say. She looks at him, yearning for something she's not getting.
N: DOROTHEA You think that's me? JAMIE I don't know. DOROTHEA You think you know me better cause you read that? JAMIE No. DOROTHEA Then why're you reading this to me? JAMIE I just thought it was interesting.
C: DOROTHEA
D: I don't need to read a book to know about me. He's pushed out of the room by her vibe. Dorothea's becoming angry. INT. BEACH - DAY Dorothea sits alone on the beach. Smoking and thinking, feelings brewing. INT. DOROTHEA'S KITCHEN - DAY Dorothea finds Abbie in the kitchen, something's on her mind.
C: DOROTHEA
D: I appreciate you trying to help, I do, but just think you're taking it too far. And this stuff, with the women's movement, I respect but It's complicated for him. Abbie's confused.
C: ABBIE
D: What?
C: DOROTHEA
D: He's fifteen. This hardcore feminism stuff is going too far. Abbie's surprised at Dorothea's change, she feels she was really helping, she's excited by what's been happening.

DOROTHEA'S KITCHEN Everyone's gathered around the table, busy, messy, helping themselves to Dorothea's food as she finishes getting the big meal ready. Through all the people, Camera finds Julie and William having an intense conversation - Jamie's eavesdropping one person away. We come in mid conversation.

D: Do we need to know everything I'm menstruating. that's happening to you?
N: More winces. Abbie's not going to stop helping Jamie.

C: ABBIE
D: It's a very important time for a woman. It can be very deep creatively speaking, emotionally transformative. The crew guys are uncomfortable. William tries to save it.
C: WILLIAM
D: Sex during menstruation can be very pleasurable for a woman, even provide relief from cramps. Jamie, I also want to say, never have sex with just the vagina, have sex with the whole woman.
N: DOROTHEA You too? Julie's mad at Dorothea for trying to control her relationship with Jamie - she looks straight at Jamie... JULIE My first one started while I was watching One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest with some guy. I told him I had to go, went to the market, got a box of tampons, went home, read the instructions on the box in my bathroom, figured out how to put them in. I never told my mom, she never asked, I never saw the end of Cuckoo's Nest. Silence. Jamie and Dorothea are getting more and more uncomfortable. WILLIAM Jack Nicholson's character gets a lobotomy so the big Indian guy, like suffocates him with a pillow - so he'll be, I don't know, free. More long looks at William. DOROTHEA Let's talk about something else. William's hurt. Julie's buzzed with attention, can't stop lashing out. JULIE First time I had sex I was 14... JAMIE Julie?!
C: JULIE
D: I just decided one night I was going to lose my virginity, didn't matter who. Jamie's mad or protective, or both. He tries to stop her.
C: JAMIE
D: Can you chill out?
C: ABBIE
D: Let her talk.
C: JULIE
D: I picked this guy I didn't know at a party, had fairly painful sex in his van parked in the street, just spit in his hand for lubrication, got home in time for my curfew. The carpet in his van smelled like spilled bong water. The men are awkwardly mute. Julie wakes up to what she's done, surprised she hurt Jamie. Dorothea's had it with these girls as well.
C: DOROTHEA
D: Okay, lets call it a night. C'mon guys. Dorothea herds the men from the table. Abbie examines Julie anew. Julie's finally become interesting to her, sympathetic. Dorothea pushes them out of the living room.
C: DOROTHEA
D: Show's over girls. Everyone's leaving the party. INT. DOROTHEA'S KITCHEN Abbie helps Dorothea clean up. It's hard for Abbie to get Dorothea's attention.
C: DOROTHEA
D: Jamie, we need to, there's a lot of stuff happening, I'd like to know what's going on with you. This has all been a lot for us to deal with. She just lost him, he makes an exasperated gesture.
C: JAMIE
D: I'm dealing with everything, you are dealing with nothing. He leaves, wildly pissed. Abbie and Dorothea share an angry look themselves, Abbie leaves.

E: A slut?
