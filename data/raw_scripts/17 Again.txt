S: EXT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK
N: A few cars scatter the parking lot. WE hear GRUNTS followed by the distinct sound of basketballs shredding net.
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - CONTINUOUS
N: An empty gymnasium except for a shirtless MIKE O'DONNELL, 17. Mike stands feet BEYOND the 3 point line, grabs balls from a hopper and rapidly shoots, shoots, shoots. SWISH...SWISH...SWISH. This kid's automatic. Mike's hair, a pompadour mullet a la `21 Jump Street' and short shorts circa 1989. Mustached and curly haired COACH HARVEY, 40, enters.
C: COACH HARVEY
D: Hey, O'Donnell, save some for the game.
N: Mike sinks one last jumper, turns to the Coach.
C: MIKE
D: Just warming up, Coach.
N: Coach Harvey hands Mike a towel.
C: COACH HARVEY
D: First game of the season and the scouts are already lining up. You have half the season I know you're capable of, you can play anywhere you want, Mike.
C: MIKE
D: That's the plan coach.
N: The rest of the FITCH FALCONS basketball team jogs out from the locker room followed by a PHOTOGRAPHER.
C: COACH HARVEY
D: Round up, Jock Straps! Picture time.
N: The Team assembles in the middle of the court. A PLAYER kneeling in front holds a sign, `FITCH FALCONS, 1989'.
C: MIKE
D: Hold on. Ed's not here yet.
N: DOM, 17, handsome, tall, long rat tail, scoffs-
C: DOM
D: Who cares? He's the water boy.
C: MIKE
D: And you suck, Dom, but we're letting you in the picture.
N: A shoving match breaks out between Mike and Dom.
C: COACH HARVEY
D: Hey! Hey! Knock it off.
N: Coach Harvey pulls the Players apart just as the gym doors burst open. ED FREEDMAN, 17, sporting a jacket over a WIZARD costume, runs in, trips on his robe, gets up, peels his clothes off.
C: ED
D: Sorry I'm late. I was locked in a life and death battle with the dark wizard...
C: COACH HARVEY
D: ...Fall in, Freedman. Hurry up.
N: Ed takes a spot next to Dom.
C: PHOTOGRPAHER
D: And 3, 2, 1-
N: WE see Dom reach behind Ed, grab hold of his underwear...RRRRIIIPP...FLASH. And with the flash WE cut to:
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - NIGHT
N: The Falcons run, pass and shoot on one end of the court. On the opposite end, a TEAM in BLUE warms up. Lights dim. Cue MC Hammer's `Can't Touch This'. CHEERLEADERS at center court perform the Hammer DANCE ROUTINE. PAN around the gym, everybody's doing the Hammer dance. Ed awkwardly tries to imitate Mike. Coach shakes his head in disgust and when the routine ends-
C: COACH HARVEY
D: Alright, Ladies, bring it in!
N: The Falcons swarm to the bench, take seats. Ed hands waters to the Players, skips Dom, stops at Mike.
C: MIKE
D: Ed, I can't help you with the girls if you keep showing up places dressed like the Cookie Crisp guy. Okay? Dude, don't look now but I think Muffy Campanella is scopin' you hard.
C: ED
D: For real?
N: Ed jerks around to blatantly stare at her.
C: MIKE
D: Smile, pud.
N: Ed flashes a goofy smile. MUFFY mimes puking.
C: MIKE
D: My bad.
E: CONT'D
N: GIRL'S VOICE (o.s.) Mike? SCARLET, 17, an 80's beauty, stands at the end of the bench.
C: MIKE
D: Who's that stone cold fox? Oh, it's my girlfriend. I'm glad you're here, Scar. This whole scout thing's got me wicked nervous.
E: walks over
N: Dom dribbles past, smiles at Scarlet.
C: DOM
D: I'm dedicating my first basket to you, Scarlet.
C: MIKE
D: Way you shoot that might be mid- season! Everything cool?
E: to Scarlet
N: She smiles nervously, lies...
C: SCARLET
D: Oh yeah. Everything's totally copacetic.
C: MIKE SCARLET
D: Totally? Totally.
N: REFEREE blows the whistle.
C: COACH HARVEY
D: Let's go! Remember, Boys, winners get the girls. Losers please themselves!
C: MIKE
D: Excellent. Gotta run.
E: to Scarlet
N: He kisses her cheek, starts off, turns back-
C: MIKE
D: What's wrong?
E: CONT'D
N: LONG SHOT: We hear nothing but see Mike's body deflate. He steps away from Scarlet towards center court. Muffy and her friends mock Ed and laugh hysterically
C: ED
D: Do you really think Muffy's in to me?
N: Mike, in a daze walks right past Ed. Takes his place for the jump ball. The Crowd stomps and cheers LOUDLY. The Ref is about to toss the ball. Mike looks up at the stands, sees a crushed Scarlet heading for the exit. Mike's torn. Play or go after her. He goes after her.
C: COACH HARVEY
D: Where you going!? O'Donnell!?
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/TUNNEL - NIGHT
N: Mike rushes in.
C: MIKE
D: Scar! Wait.
N: She turns, slumps against the wall. Mike catches up to her. Mike leans in and kisses Scarlet.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PALISADES NEIGHBORHOOD. PRESENT DAY - MORNING
N: Opulent HOMES. OCEAN views. Luxury CARS. Manicured LAWNS. The sound of an alarm clock shatters the silence as WE settle in on a large, MEDITERRANEAN STYLE HOUSE.
S: INT. ED'S HOUSE/MIKE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
N: MIKE O'DONNELL, now 36, angrily slaps the alarm off...6 AM. He climbs out of bed, bones creaking, stiff, groans.
S: INT. BATHROOM - MORNING
N: A showered, suited Mike stands before the mirror, knots a tie around his neck.
C: MIKE
D: Today is going to be a good day. I love my job. I am a lucky man. Who's lucky? Mike O'Donnell.
E: UNINSPIRED
N: Mike yanks his tie straight up as if he were hanging himself.
S: INT. ED'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - MORNING
N: ED FREEDMAN, now 36, lies on a portable table in his boxers. ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLES protrude from every inch of his body, neck and face...at least 5000 needles. A HOT, YOUNG ACUPUNCTURIST adds more to him.
C: ACUPUNCTURIST
D: Can you feel your Qi flowing freely?
C: ED
D: I'm not sure if its my Qi or internal bleeding.
N: Mike enters, shakes his head in amusement.
C: MIKE
D: What are you doing now?
N: Ed looks over, sees Mike watching.
C: ED
D: There he is. There's Mr. Sunshine. Fei Jing Acupuncture. It's all the rage. Makes you look five years younger.
N: Ed climbs slowly off the table, shuffles over, groaning in pain the entire way. He pours himself a shot of BROWN LIQUID from a pitcher, throws the shot back and immediately SPITS it all over the place.
C: ED
D: What's this brown stuff again?
E: CONT'D calls to Acupuncturist
C: ACUPUNCTURIST
D: Rhinoceros urine. Pure protein.
C: ED
D: Delish! The girl has absolutely no clue what she's doing.
E: to Mike
C: MIKE
D: Then why are you letting her stick needles in you?
C: ED
D: Because she's hot. But today's not about me. It's about you becoming the new regional sales manager.
C: MIKE
D: I better be. I've invested 18 years of my life in that miserable company.
C: ED
D: No negativity. Negativity's for the 800 pound fat lady who needs to be airlifted out of bed. You, Michael Shawn O'Donnell, are a winner.
C: MIKE
D: A winner doesn't have to crash at his best friend's house because he was kicked out of his own house.
C: ED
D: Are you kidding?! It doesn't get any better than this!
E: MORE
C: ED
D: I gotta get back. My legs just went numb. Good luck today.
E: CONT'D
N: Ed drags painfully back to the Acupuncturist.
S: EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - MORNING
N: Mike wheels his Audi A4 below a nondescript, two level building. Sign reads, `Wyatt Pharmaceuticals'.
S: INT. WYATT PHARMACEUTICALS/CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING
N: PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG POSTERS cover the walls. Smiling faces, happy couples...little pills. Surrounding a conference table are Mike's colleagues...HOT WOMEN, 20 to 35, in skimpy business suits, chatting away. Mike sits amongst them, the only male present. A glum look on his face. WENDY, bubbly, ditsy, 22, leans over to him.
C: WENDY
D: Congratulations, Mike. You deserve it. You're like a totally amazing salesman.
C: MIKE
D: Thanks, Wendy. That like totally means so much to me.
N: ROGER, 23, boss, strides through the door.
C: ROGER
D: Good morning, peeps. As you all know, today I'll be naming the new regional sales manager. What's it take to be an RSM? Leadership skills, a comprehensive knowledge of today's prescription pharmaceuticals and most importantly a dedicated soldier.
N: Mike straightens his tie, buttons his suit jacket.
C: ROGER
D: All being said, congratulations- Wendy.
E: CONT'D Mike begins to rise
N: Dumbfounded, Mike slumps back into his seat. Wendy springs up out of hers, SCREAMING and BOUNCING.
C: ROGER
D: Now go out there and sell some drugs peeps!
E: CONT'D
N: The Women stream out.
C: MIKE
D: How could you do this to me? I've been a salesman here 18 years. Wendy's only been here 2 months!?
C: ROGER
D: Look, your sales are admittedly better but she has the college degree. What can I do?
C: MIKE
D: You can give me the promotion, Roger!
C: ROGER
D: Things have changed. I couldn't even hire you now with only a high school diploma. My hands are tied, bro-ski.
N: Mike swallows his pride and exits.
S: EXT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - DUSK
N: Mike pulls into the empty parking lot, climbs out of his car and into the building.
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DUSK
N: Mike hurries down the hall, opens a door, peeks his head in.
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - DUSK
N: Mike peers around...nobody.
C: MIKE
D: Alex?
N: No answer. A basketball sits in the middle of the floor. Mike enters, picks up the ball, begins dribbling...faster, between his legs, around his back, up to the 3 point line-
C: MIKE
D: 3, 2, 1-
E: CONT'D
N: Mike hits a perfect jumper at the imaginary buzzer, smiles.
C: MIKE
D: The kid's still got it.
E: CONT'D
N: Mike dashes for the bouncing ball, scoops it up, goes for a reverse lay up, makes it but when he lands...he lands...CRACK...hard. Mike grabs his lower back, groans-
C: MIKE
D: Ooooh. That was stupid.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DUSK
N: Mike limps out of the gym, wanders over to a wall covered in PHOTOGRAPHS...Fitch basketball teams of the past. Mike searches the pictures until he finds it...the photo WE saw being taken earlier...the team of 1989. Ed mid howl from Dom's wedgy. Mike stares at the photograph...lost in time and thought. The smiling, confident image of his youth stares back at him. MALE VOICE (o.s.) You know someone in that picture? Mike startles from his daydream, turns. A kind-faced, old JANITOR, stands behind him, mop in hand.
C: MIKE
D: I do. Me. I'm in the center there.
N: The Janitor leans in, takes a closer look at Young Mike.
C: JANITOR
D: Adolescence can be so cruel.
C: MIKE
D: What are you talking about? (lost in the picture
C: AGAIN)
D: I had life by the balls in that picture. Everything was possible. Then a few minutes later, pffffft, all gone.
C: JANITOR
D: `For of all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these: `It might have been...'
C: MIKE
D: That'll be my epitaph.
C: JANITOR
D: We all have regrets.
C: MIKE
D: Why's it have to be that way?
C: JANITOR
D: Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. Can't hurt to ask. You never know who's listening, Michael.
N: Michael wistfully eyes the old photo, looks back to the JANITOR-
C: MIKE
D: How did you know...
C: ALEX
D: ...What are you doing, Dad?
E: O.S.
N: ALEX, 15, messy hair and slight, and MAGGIE, 17 and awkwardly pretty, appear at the other end of the hall.
C: MIKE
D: Hey, Guys. I was just talking to-
N: Mike looks back to the Janitor...GONE.
C: MIKE
D: Never mind. Sorry I'm late. You ready to get some dinner then?
E: CONT'D
N: They make their way towards the door. Mike limping.
C: ALEX
D: Why are you limping?
C: MIKE
D: Tweaked my back pumping iron. Really, really heavy iron.
S: INT. CHEESECAKE FACTORY - NIGHT
N: Mike, Alex and Maggie sit before dinner. Alex eats heartily. Maggie quietly pushes her food around.
C: MIKE
D: I bet your chompin' at the bit for hoop season to start.
C: ALEX
D: Yeah, me and the guys are running drills, scrimmaging, getting in shape.
N: Maggie stifles a laugh.
C: MIKE
D: That's my boy. Remember, it's not how big you are-
C: ALEX
D: -it's how big you play.
N: Father and Son touch fists.
C: MIKE
D: And what about you, Mags? What's new?
C: MAGGIE
D: Nothing.
C: ALEX
D: She got into Georgetown.
C: MIKE
D: You did!? That's fantastic!
C: MAGGIE
D: It's no big deal.
C: MIKE
D: It's a huge deal. That's a great university. I'm proud of you. Am I missing something here?
E: Maggie remains quiet
C: MAGGIE
D: You wouldn't understand.
C: MIKE
D: Try me.
C: MAGGIE
D: I have a lot of emotional stress right now. My friends are all going to different schools, I'm not even sure...
C: MIKE
D: That's not stress. Wait `til you get out into the real world, get a crappy job, have some smarmy twerp- boss calling you bro-ski...
N: Maggie rolls her eyes.
C: ALEX
D: Did you get the promotion, Dad?
C: MIKE
D: Still waiting to hear.
N: Mike forces a smile hiding his disappointment.
S: EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY/MIKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Mike pulls up behind a `Dom's Nursery' van. He, Alex and Maggie step out. Mike eyes the van with disdain.
C: MIKE
D: Is your mom home?
C: ALEX
D: She's probably out back.
C: MIKE
D: Hey, next week we'll have a barbecue at Uncle Ed's. Sound good?
C: MAGGIE
D: I'm counting down the minutes.
N: Maggie heads straight for the modest ranch house and inside.
C: MIKE
D: What's with her?
C: ALEX
D: We see you once a week for a couple hours. What do you expect?
N: Alex follows Maggie into the house. Mike makes his way around back.
S: EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY
N: As Mike rounds the corner, he almost runs into a smiling Dom Johnson, 36. Don lugs 3 loaded trash bags.
C: DOM
D: Hey, Mike. Good to see you. Tough break, you and Scarlet.
C: MIKE
D: Bite me, Dom.
N: Dom serves Mike a cocky wink, continues on. Mike scowls. Scarlet, 36, slams a shovel into the ground, wedges it beneath a dying shrub and rips it out.
C: MIKE
D: A little late for a delivery isn't it?
E: CONT'D
C: SCARLET
D: Dom was in the neighborhood. He offered to make a dump run for me.
C: MIKE
D: Doesn't he live 30 miles from here?
C: SCARLET
D: What's your point?
C: MIKE
D: Come on. He's been after you since 10th grade and he's after you now.
C: SCARLET
D: At least someone's after me.
N: Mike smiles playfully and begins to serenade-
C: MIKE
D: `In touch with the ground, I'm on the hunt I'm after you.'
N: Scarlet shakes her head-
C: SCARLET
D: Please, Mike. This isn't high school. That's not gonna work.
C: MIKE
D: `Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd, and I'm hungry like the wolf.'
N: Mike flirtatiously stalks her. Scarlet fights smiling.
C: SCARLET
D: You can stop now. It's not working.
C: MIKE
D: `Mouth is alive, with juices like wine, and I'm hungry like the wolf'
N: Mike gets close to Scarlet's face. She smiles, stops herself and pushes him away.
C: SCARLET
D: You no longer have the right to invoke the "wolf."
N: A chastised Mike eyes the yard...it's a WRECK...holes and mounds of dirt everywhere, carcasses of dead plants, bushes and flowers strewn about.
C: MIKE
D: Why are you destroying the yard?
N: Scarlet stops shoveling, wipes dirt from her face.
C: SCARLET
D: I'm gonna use it as a showpiece for clients. Thanks for asking.
C: MIKE
D: Kind of a big undertaking isn't it?
C: SCARLET
D: I am a landscape designer. Then again you barely took an interest in my work so I guess that's a fair question.
N: An awkward silence. Then-
C: MIKE
D: I didn't get it.
C: SCARLET
D: I'm sorry. But maybe this is what you needed. Maybe it's time you looked for something else?
C: MIKE
D: That's a great idea, Scar. Because there are so many options out there for a 36 year old with only a high school diploma.
N: Scarlet throws the shovel to the ground.
C: SCARLET
D: And it's all my fault, isn't it?
C: MIKE
D: I didn't say that.
C: SCARLET
D: No, but it's what you think, right?
N: Mike's silence says it all. Scarlet fights back tears.
C: SCARLET
D: I never asked you to marry me.
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: But I did.
N: Scarlet shakes her head in frustration.
C: SCARLET
D: I'm sorry you're not happy with the way your life turned out Mike, really, I am, but you're not the victim here.
N: Scarlet goes back to shoveling. Mike turns, steps, falls into a hole.
S: INT. MIKE'S AUDI - NIGHT
N: A somber Mike drives alongside the Los Angeles River. An old song plays low on the radio...static...then...BOOM. THUNDER roars scaring Mike and literally shaking the Audi. SPLASH. RAIN drops in buckets.
C: MIKE
D: Jesus!
N: Mike turns the wipers on high. Not much help. He slows the car to a crawl, straining to see out the windshield. LIGHTNING flashes. We see the Janitor leaning over the railing looking into the raging river. Mike brakes, throws his door open, jumps out into the pouring rain.
S: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
C: MIKE
D: Hey!? Get away from there!?
N: Mike, blinded by the rain makes his way to the railing. The Janitor's GONE.
C: MIKE
D: Oh no!! Hello!?
E: CONT'D
N: Mike leans over the rickety railing, looks down... The phosphorescent water swirls angrily...rising quickly. It's mesmerizing. Magical. Mike can't take his eyes off- LIGHTENING FLASHES Mike's 17 year-old face reflection stares back up at him.
C: MIKE
D: What the-
E: CONT'D
N: CRACK. The railing BREAKS. Mike FALLS...SPLASH...headlong into the river.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ED'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING
N: Mike's Audi rolls into the driveway. The door swings open. A muddy, shoeless foot steps out followed by a shoed foot but in no better shape. WE follow the feet, tattered slacks dragging on the cement, to the door. 2 filthy hands dig into pockets, searching-
C: MIKE
D: Damn it. Ed! Ed! I lost my key!
E: pushes doorbell
S: INT. ED'S HOUSE - MORNING
N: Ed, wrapped in a robe, tissue between his toes, wobbles to the door so as not to mess up his freshly polished nails.
C: ED
D: Coming! I've been worried sick! WHERE-
N: Ed opens the door...standing before him is Mike, covered in MUD. His ripped, grimy suit now hangs off of him because...HE'S 17 AGAIN. Ed's eyes widen with FEAR.
C: MIKE
D: I've had a really rough night.
C: ED
D: AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
N: Ed slams the door, frantically wobbles away. The door opens, ANGLE ON the muddy feet as they enter and follow the trail of cotton balls up the stairs and to the bathroom door.
S: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
N: ANGLE ON Ed cowering against the back wall, brandishing an over-sized loofah. The door slowly swings open. Ed gasps-
C: ED
D: Don't come any closer! I'll use it!
C: MIKE
D: What are you gonna do? Exfoliate me to death? You got into my samples case again, didn't you?
E: Ed shrieks
N: A whimpering Ed points to the mirror.
C: MIKE
D: What's your problem, it's only mud.
E: CONT'D
N: The muddy feet turn toward the mirror and-
C: MIKE
D: AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!
E: CONT'D
N: ANGLE ON the mirror. Mike's 17. He turns on the water, splashes his face frantically. Mud gone. He's still 17.
C: MIKE
D: AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
E: CONT'D
N: Mike tears his suit jacket and shirt off...hairless chest. He yanks off his pants, peeks down his boxers-
C: MIKE
D: I'm dreaming right? Is this some kind of hallucination?
E: CONT'D
N: Mike pulls Ed up by his robe.
C: MIKE
D: Do something! Anything! Pinch me!
E: CONT'D
N: Ed throws a knee into Mike's nuts, bolts out the door SCREAMING. Mike crumbles.
C: MIKE
D: I said pinch!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. ED'S HOUSE/FOYER - DAY
N: Ed reaches the door, fumbles with the locks. He just manages to open the door when Mike tackles him to the floor. The two buddies roll around, limbs intertwined.
C: MIKE
D: Calm down! We need to talk! We can work this out!
N: FEMALE VOICE (o.s.) Aye dios mio! They stop wrestling, look up. The LATINO MAID stands in the doorway genuflecting.
C: ED
D: Maria, we're just friends. Really.
N: The Maid hurries off muttering prayers in Spanish.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ED'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - LATER
C: ED
D: My theory is that you were transformed by a freak congruence of some of the planets most volatile elements. I've recreated the exact contents of the LA River. The toxic pollutants, the contaminants.
N: REVEAL Mike in the gurgling green water of the hot tub.
C: MIKE
D: Well, it obviously isn't working.
C: ED
D: That's because the cocktail's not complete.
N: Ed picks up a TOASTER attached to an extension cord.
C: ED
D: Last night we had the worst electrical storm of the last hundred years.
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: Is that true?
C: ED
D: It was pretty bad.
N: Ed raises the toaster-
C: MIKE
D: Wait!! Wait!! Wait!! Do you really think this'll work?
C: ED
D: It could.
N: Ed tosses it in. Mike screams. Nothing happens.
C: ED
D: Oops. Came unplugged. Won't be a moment.
E: CONT'D
N: Ed reaches down to plug it in.
C: ED
D: What were you doing by the river anyway?
E: CONT'D
N: CLOSE ON MIKE, Light bulb goes off. He leaps out, runs for the house.
C: MIKE
D: The janitor!
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - DAY
N: The Audi screeches to a stop in front of the school. Mike bounds out, wearing a robe, races inside.
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DAY
N: Mike rushes past baffled STUDENTS, asking no one in PARTICULAR-
C: MIKE
D: Has anyone seen the janitor? Is the janitor here? Where's the janitor?
N: Mike reaches the familiar wall of pictures. Kids point, laugh, stare. A FEMALE JANITOR, steps from a room.
C: MIKE
D: Excuse me! Excuse me!? Can you tell me where I can find the night janitor?
E: CONT'D
C: JANITOR
D: I'm the only custodial engineer currently employed here.
C: MIKE
D: There was an old guy, white hair. I showed him this picture of me-
N: Mike points to the 1989 team photo.
C: JANITOR
D: -Of you? That picture's from 1989.
N: Mike backs away from the picture and the Janitor.
C: MIKE
D: Right. Forget it.
N: Confused, Mike stumbles to the bathroom. He's about to enter, three letter jacket wearing JOCKS, STAN, JAZZ and KEVIN, burst out laughing, knocking Mike on the way by.
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/BATHROOM - DAY
N: Mike enters, moves to a sink, turns the water on- VOICE (o.s.) Can I get a little help in here? Mike turns, sees what appears to be UNDERWEAR stretched over the corner of a closed stall door. Mike approaches the door, swings it open...there HANGS Alex, sneakers dangling 3 feet off the ground. The back of his underwear wrenched up over the corner of the door.
C: MIKE
D: Alex? What are you doing up there?
C: ALEX
D: I wanted to see if I could get my nuts into my esophagus. What do you think I'm doing!? Get me down!
C: MIKE
D: Okay. Okay. I'll get you down.
N: Mike pulls the underwear off the door. Alex drops, reaches down his pants, adjusts his underwear.
C: ALEX
D: How do you know my name?
C: MIKE
D: I'm...Mark...Freedman. Your Uncle Ed's son. He told me to look out for you.
C: ALEX
D: Uncle Ed has a son?
C: MIKE
D: Believe me, it's gonna be a surprise to him too. Did those guys do this to you?
C: ALEX
D: Goons from the basketball team.
C: MIKE
D: But why?
C: ALEX
D: Because they can and so they do on a daily basis.
C: MIKE
D: But you're one of them.
E: SHOCKED
C: ALEX
D: No, I'm not. Nice robe, guy. Gotta go.
N: Alex walks out bowlegged. A devastated Mike watches him go.
S: INT. AUDI - MOMENTS LATER
N: Mike drives off out of the parking lot. To his left he spies- ANGLE ON: Stan and Maggie making out against Stan's Mustang. Mike pounds on the horn, scaring them apart. Drive's off.
S: INT. ED'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Ed sits at the island, a laptop in front of him. On the screen WE see he's perusing www.spellscursesincantations.com. The sound of the front door opening and closing. Mike enters.
C: ED
D: Did you find the janitor?
C: MIKE
D: He doesn't exist. Nothing makes sense.
C: ED
D: Did he ask you for your soul?
C: MIKE
D: No?
C: ED
D: That's a good sign. We can eliminate Satan. I think what we're dealing with here is a spell of enlightenment. "Spell affect"..."casting procedure"...yada, yada, yada. Basically it's a learning spell. There's something you need to figure out and until you do you'll stay a kid. My guess is that janitor was probably a war...
E: clicks on a link peruses the page
C: MIKE
D: ...I'm going back to high school.
C: ED
D: ...lock. I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? Because I thought you just said you were-
C: MIKE
D: Going back to high school.
N: Mike grabs a beer from the fridge, cracks it. As Mike is about to take a sip, Ed swipes the beer from his hand...CHUGS it down.
C: ED
D: Are you out of your freaking mind!?
C: MIKE
D: My son was hanging by his underwear from a bathroom stall door and my daughter was being mauled by a smarmy gorilla. They need me.
C: ED
D: What about your job?
C: MIKE
D: Email and telephone. I got it covered.
C: ED
D: Well, Scarlet, then. What are you gonna tell her?
C: MIKE
D: Nothing.
C: ED
D: You're just gonna disappear?
C: MIKE
D: To be honest, I think she'd rather have it that way. What's with the attitude?
C: ED
D: Because I know you're going to suck me into this and I'm not going back there, Mike. You'll never get me to go back to Fitch. Never!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/OFFICE - DAY
C: ED
D: I hate you.
N: PULL BACK TO REVEAL Ed and Mike sit outside Principal's office. Mike is dressed in an overly exaggerated hip style, (a grown-ups concept of what's cool- he looks ridiculous).
C: MIKE
D: Take a deep breath. All you have to do is enroll me and say as little as possible.
N: Ed calms. Mike pulls a manila folder out of his book bag.
C: MIKE
D: Are you sure these look legit?
E: CONT'D
C: ED
D: Please. I created software used to launch the space shuttle. I think I'm capable of forging some report cards. What's up with the gear?
E: offended/cocky
C: MIKE
D: This is hip teenage apparel. I got it right off the mannequin at Ed Hardy.
C: SECRETARY
D: Ms. Goodwin will see you now.
N: Mike and Ed stand, head for the door marked `Principal'.
C: ED
D: First sign this old hag is on to us I'M-
N: Mike and Ed step through the door-
S: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY
N: MS. GOODWIN, 35, sits behind her desk...she's no hag. She's an attractive, buttoned-up professional. Ed's face lights up and without missing a beat-
C: ED
D: -so glad we chose this school. I'm Ed Freedman.
N: Ed steps in front of Mike, shakes Ms. Goodwin's hand.
C: JULIE
D: Nice to meet you. I'm Julie Goodwin, principal here at Fitch Senior High. And you behind there? You are?
N: Mike tries to peer around Ed. Mike finally physically moves Ed steps aside.
C: ED
D: Oh, right. Sorry. This little chicken pock here is Mark. Say hello, Mark.
N: Ed smiles, rubs Mikes head vigorously. Mike slaps his hand.
C: MIKE
D: Nice to meet you, Julie.
C: JULIE
D: Around here you're going to have to use Ms. Goodwin. Please, sit.
N: Mike and Ed sit.
C: ED
D: Before we get started I want you to know that Mark's a bastard.
C: JULIE
D: Excuse me!?
C: ED
D: I had him out of wedlock. So the answer is yes, I'm very single...and very rich.
C: MIKE
D: Dad met mom in Thailand. She's a very successful prostitute.
T: Ed's smile fades.
C: JULIE
D: O-Kay. Did you bring your transcripts?
N: Mike hands Julie the folder. As Julie browses through it, Ed and Mike get into a pinching, elbowing fight. When she looks up, the friends stop. Both smiling.
C: JULIE
D: So the last school you went to was Cutler High in Connecticut. And you were a straight A student. Very impressive.
E: CONT'D
C: ED
D: I help him with his homework...a lot.
C: MIKE
D: Oh, dad, the doctor called. You were right. It is herpes.
N: Ed's jaw drops. Julie rises abruptly.
C: JULIE
D: I think it's time we got Mark to class. Lisa! Lisa!
N: The door opens, in steps LISA, 18.
C: JULIE
D: Lisa, will you print out a schedule for Mark and show him to class?
E: CONT'D
C: LISA
D: Sure. Come on, Mark.
N: Mike stands. Ed addresses him as fatherly as he knows how-
C: ED
D: Be a good boy now. And sit up straight.
N: Mike glares at Ed, follows Lisa out. Ed turns to Julie.
C: ED
D: They grow up so fast. Mojito?
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: I beg your pardon.
C: ED
D: You strike me as a Mojito gal. I know this little Cuban place, great PLANTAINS-
C: JULIE
D: -Yeah, no. I don't date my students' parents. It's a rule of mine.
C: ED
D: I'll enroll him somewhere else.
C: JULIE
D: I really need to get back to work.
N: Julie ushers Ed to the door.
C: ED
D: See you at the next bake sale then?
N: Julie shuts the door, shakes her head in disbelief.
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CALCULUS CLASS - DAY
N: Mike steps in. Scattered giggles at his appearance. Mike takes a seat, eyes three sexy girls wearing next to nothing, SAMANTHA, LAUREN and JAMIE, busy texting on their phones.
C: MIKE
D: Do their mothers know they dress like that?
N: A GIRL next to him leans over-
C: GIRL
D: Those are the Wonder Bras. Beware.
N: The Jocks, Stan, Jazz and Kevin strut in. Mike's eyes narrow. Stan stops before Mike, looks him up and down-
C: STAN
D: What did you did do? Mug the mannequin at the Ed Hardy store?
C: JAZZ
D: Tool!
N: Laughter from the class. Mike shies. The Jocks sit, Stan behind Mike. Just as the last bell rings, Maggie rushes in, sits with the Bras.
C: MAGGIE
D: Oh thank God he's not here. I ran all the way from-
N: Something catches Maggie's eye. It's Mike waving to her.
C: MAGGIE
D: Why's that freak waving at me.
E: CONT'D
N: Maggie places a hand over her face, looks down. MALE VOICE (o.s.) Take your seats. Stop the talking. MR. ADAMS, 45, prissy, strides in carrying a stack of papers.
C: MR. ADAMS
D: Here are yesterday's tests. Let's see how you all did.
N: Moans from the class. Adams walks up and down the aisle slapping them down on the desks..
C: MR. ADAMS
D: C-, C, B-, D, D-, F
E: CONT'D
N: Adams reaches Maggie, drops the test on her desk...
C: MR. ADAMS
D: D for O'Donnell.
E: CONT'D
N: Humiliated, Maggie lowers her head.
C: MR. ADAMS
D: Let me guess. Early acceptance? Where are we going?
E: CONT'D Maggie nods
C: MAGGIE
D: Georgetown.
C: MR. ADAMS
D: If you flunk senior calculus you'll be lucky to get into beauty school, missy. So, if you plan on slacking your way through my class, don't. Save your parents tuition money and pick up a blow dryer...
N: Mike angrily stands-
C: MIKE
D: Enough!
N: Mr. Adams turns to Mike.
C: MR. ADAMS
D: Excuse me?
C: MIKE
D: Do you think humiliating a 17 year- old in front of her peers is helpful or do you just get off on it?
C: MR. ADAMS
D: And you are?
C: MIKE
D: Mark Freedman. It's my first day.
N: Adams turns, walks back towards the front of the room.
C: MR. ADAMS
D: Well, Mr. Freedman-
N: Stan signals his friends, takes out a LIGHTER, flicks it, leans forward and places the flame BETWEEN Mike's legs. The flame GLOWS RED against Mike's jeans. The Jocks and Bras pull out their cells and begin VIDEOING. Adams scribbles on a pad-
C: MR. ADAMS
D: -you've earned yourself a trip to the principal's office. Welcome to Fitch.
E: CONT'D
N: Adams rips the paper off, holds it out towards Mike. Mike sniffs at the air-
C: MIKE
D: Is someone barbecuing? YYYYEEEEOOOOOWWWWWWW!!!!
E: BEAT
N: Mike LEAPS out of his shoes. A FLAME runs up his crotch. LAUGHTER. Mike, SCREAMING, runs around the room fanning his package.
C: MR. ADAMS
D: Get out, Mr. Freedman!
N: Mike snatches the slip from Adams and out the door.
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CAFETERIA - DAY
N: A packed lunchroom. The CLIQUES sit amongst themselves. WE notice all the KIDS hunched over STARING AT THEIR PHONES. Mike enters carrying a bag lunch. A BLACK BURN MARK on the crotch of his pants. A GAYSIAN spots him, yells-
C: GAYSIAN
D: Go Hot Pants! Do your dance, Girl!
N: The entire cafeteria turns to Mike and erupts in laughter. As Mike passes each table, WE see the kids are watching his `fire dance' on their phones. Mike approaches a table of the 3 BIGGEST LOSERS in school, unkempt hair, fat, acne. Mike begins to sit when-
C: BIGGEST LOSER
D: Look, we feel your pain. We really do. But life's hard enough, Brother.
N: Mike nods, continues on past the snickering and catcalls until he sees Maggie and the Wonder Bras. ANGLE: Wonder Bra Table. Maggie, Samantha, Jamie and Lauren pick around plates of cafeteria food.
C: MAGGIE
D: What's the big deal? He stuck up for me in class. It was a nice thing to do.
C: SAMANTHA
D: He was totally sexing on you.
C: LAUREN
D: He's coming. Pretend you're not here.
N: Mike approaches, big smile. The Wonder Bras look off in every direction except Mike's.
C: MIKE
D: Hi, Maggie. Hi, girls. I'm Mark-
N: The Girls continue looking away, ignoring Mike.
C: MIKE
D: Girls? Hello? Anyone home?
E: CONT'D
C: LAUREN
D: Oh my God. Can't you see we're not here?
C: MIKE
D: Good. So there's plenty of room then.
N: Mike drops down next to Samantha and across from Maggie.
C: JAMIE
D: Oh, look. He brought a bag lunch. How sped.
E: special ed
N: Mike hides his lunch.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Look, this table is V.I.P. You're a NIP.
C: MIKE
D: What's a NIP?
C: LAUREN
D: Not Important. Go away.
C: MIKE
D: Maggie, why are you friends with these horrible girls?
C: MAGGIE
D: Listen, I appreciate what you did in class but, I already have a boyfriend.
C: MIKE
D: You have a boyfriend? Excuse me a second.
E: his phone rings
N: Mike pulls out an OLDER Blackberry phone, looks at the caller ID...Scarlet. He sends it to voice mail.
C: JAMIE
D: He still gets calls. How 2007.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I think my grandfather has that phone.
C: MIKE
D: Maggie, could we talk somewhere ELSE-
N: The sound of a bouncing ball interrupts. MALE VOICE (o.s.) Yo! Mike turns. Stan, Jazz and Kevin swagger over.
C: STAN
D: Bro-ski, what are you doing at our table?
C: MAGGIE
D: Nothing. He was just leaving.
N: Maggie nods for Mike to go.
C: MIKE
D: We should do this again sometime.
E: SARCASTIC
N: Mike stands. Stan pulls Maggie up, starts making out with her, hands all over her. WE can see Mike's blood BOIL until-
C: MIKE
D: Get your hands off her, you little punk!
E: CONT'D
N: Oops. Stan stops groping, steps over to Mike, a solid foot taller than him.
C: STAN
D: You gotta problem with me, `bra?
N: Mike looks around...the entire cafeteria watches. Defeated-
C: MIKE
D: No, no, I don't.
N: Stan takes Mike's hat off, picks up an ice cream from Maggie's tray, puts the ice cream in the hat, places it back on Mike's head and SMUSHES it down.
C: STAN
D: Now make like Tom and Cruise.
N: Flush with humiliation and ice cream dripping down his face, Mike turns and walks out.
C: MAGGIE
D: That was so not cool.
C: STAN
D: What? I'll buy you another ice cream.
N: WE see Alex, seated by himself at a back table, shake his head in disgust.
S: INT. RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT
N: A beaten down Mike sits alongside Ed at the bar.
C: MIKE
D: It was terrible. The place is evil, Ed. That building needs to be exorcised.
C: ED
D: Come on. It couldn't have been that bad.
C: MIKE
D: My beanbag was lit on fire, videoed and sent to every member of student body.
C: ED
D: Yeah, I caught it on youtube. Funny stuff.
C: MIKE
D: They mocked my clothes and phone. My daughter got a tongue bath in front of me and I have mint chip in my ears.
C: ED
D: High school's great, isn't it?
N: The BARTENDER approaches.
C: BARTENDER
D: What can I get you?
C: MIKE
D: Double scotch neat.
C: BARTENDER
D: Funny, kid.
C: ED
D: Get the boy a Shirley Temple. Extra cherries.
N: The Bartender nods serves up the drinks. Mike miserably plucks a cherry off his pink drink.
C: MIKE
D: I'm not going back there.
C: ED
D: Mike, you're an adult sitting on 36 years of experience. You should be dominating these kids, ripping their hearts out.
N: An OLDER WOMAN takes a seat next to the boys.
C: MIKE
D: I know why you're encouraging me all of a sudden.
C: ED
D: Because I'm a supportive dad.
C: MIKE
D: Because you want to nail my principal.
C: ED
D: Did she ask about me?
C: MIKE
D: She's not your type. She's smart.
C: ED
D: As far as I can tell that's her only flaw. I need a reason to see her again. You could flunk your classes, start a fight, vandalise the place. You'll figure it out. Then I can rush in, a teary eyed, helpless, single dad who can't handle his angry, kitten killing son. What do you think?
N: The Older Lady, having listened to it all, turns to Ed-
C: OLDER LADY
D: I think you should be reported to child services!
C: ED
D: Mind your business, Lady. This is a family matter.
N: The Lady turns away in disgust.
C: MIKE
D: I can't do it. I don't have it in me.
C: ED
D: Hey, no sweat off my sack. Tell Alex to stop wearing underwear all together. He'll be fine. That's what I did.
N: Mike eyes Ed, considers just how "well adjusted" Ed is. A determined look comes over Mike. He pounds the bar.
C: MIKE
D: You're right! My kids need me.
C: ED
D: At'a boy. Now what you need is a crash course on being a teen in
N: A MONTAGE OF MIKE'S CRASH COURSE
S: EXT. MAGAZINE STAND - NIGHT
N: The Boys gather a stack of TEEN MAGAZINES and TABLOID RAGS. Ed slips a MELONS Magazine into the pile.
S: INT. TRENDY HAIR SALON - NIGHT
N: A picture of a YOUNG, POPULAR STAR torn from one of the teen mags hangs on the mirror. A HAIRDRESSER cuts away and highlights Mike's long locks. Ed sits beside Mike sipping wine, enjoying a manicure.
S: INT. TRENDY CLOTHES STORE - NIGHT
N: It's the PRETTY WOMAN scene. 2 hip SALESGIRLS pull clothes from racks. A clean cut Mike tries on sneakers, jeans, T- shirts, hoodies, shirts, jewelry. Ed nods with his approval or disapproval. At the register, the Girls hand Mike his bags of clothes. Ed takes out his cell to put their numbers in it. The Girls frown and go back to work.
S: INT. VIRGIN MEGA MUSIC STORE - NIGHT
N: Mike and Ed stand before the wall of 100 top albums. Both wear headphones listening and moving to the music.
S: INT. ED'S HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Mike and Ed, surrounded by the magazines and music discs, sit before the computer. Ed TEACHES Mike how to create a MYSPACE page. Bogus About Me and Interests. Photoshopped pictures of Mike in exotic locations. All the `now' movies, music and books. They fill his Friends section with only hot girls. The Boys view the flashy, finished product, tap fists. This page makes `Mark Freedman' look like a playboy.
S: INT. MAC STORE - NIGHT
N: A SALESMAN hands a smiling Mike his new iPhone.
S: INT. ED'S HOUSE/MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Mike sits on the bed, types away on his laptop. A knock on the door. Mike looks up and YELLS. Ed stands in the doorway, his entire body and head wrapped in SEAWEED.
C: ED
D: Before you ask, it's a seaweed wrap. I'm detoxifying as well as losing an inch or 2 from my problem areas.
C: MIKE
D: There must be a very hot girl downstairs.
C: ED
D: There is. What are you doing?
C: MIKE
D: I forwarded my calls to my new phone, sent some work emails and just lobbed one to Scarlet, told her I was in Peru finding myself. Think she'll buy it?
C: ED
D: Probably not because when she called earlier I told her you were being detained at Guantanamo. Ready for tomorrow?
C: MIKE
D: I am so ready.
N: Ed flips Mike a set of keys. Mike's eyes light up.
C: ED
D: That ought'a put you over the top. And don't forget to hook me up son.
N: Ed plods off. Off Mike's huge smile.
S: EXT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - MORNING
N: The usual pre-school ritual. Stan, Jazz, Kevin, the Wonder Bras and Maggie all hang around Stan's `stang. Stan and Maggie wrapped in a heated embrace, kissing. HONK. A horn blares. Stan and Maggie jump out of the way. An ASTON MARTIN VANQUISH stops next to the crew. The tinted window rolls down revealing the new and improved Mike. Mike winks then rolls on past.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh my god. Was that-
C: JAMIE
D: Did you see-
C: LAUREN
D: I told you he was cute.
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DAY
N: It's the MOMENT. Mike walks the hallway, handsome and hip. Samantha, Lauren and Jamie text by their lockers. Mike struts up to them. The Bras smile.
C: MIKE
D: So I've been here a couple days now and I think I got it figured out. You girls are lesbians, right?
N: The Bras' jaws hit the floor. Mike walks off, a huge grin on his face. Man, that felt good.
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CAFETERIA - DAY
N: Mike steps from the kitchen area carrying a TRAY, scans the crowded room, finds Alex seated at a table ALONE. It's a heartbreaking image. Mike approaches-
C: MIKE
D: Mind if I sit here?
C: ALEX
D: Mark? You look totally different.
N: Mike sits across from Alex.
C: MIKE
D: I got rid of the bull's eye on my forehead.
C: ALEX
D: Could you move to the left a little?
N: Mike inches left, peeks behind him...2 girls eat lunch together. The one facing them is a cute Latino, NICOLE, 16. Nicole smiles. Alex quickly shies away.
C: MIKE
D: Who's she?
C: ALEX
D: Nicole Lopez. She's in my Spanish class.
C: MIKE
D: Have you spoken to her?
C: ALEX
D: No. I get all stupid so I just stare.
C: MIKE
D: I'll tell you a funny story. The first time I met your mother I was so nervous-
C: ALEX
D: My mother?
C: MIKE
D: What?
C: ALEX
D: You said, `the first time I met your mother I was so nervous...'
C: MIKE
D: I did? That's weird. Is your mom hot?
C: ALEX
D: Dude.
C: MIKE
D: What's going on tonight? You wanna hang out? Do something?
C: ALEX
D: Really?
C: MIKE
D: Yeah you could show me around.
C: ALEX
D: Cool.
N: The Wonder Bras sway in, take seats at the VIP table.
C: MIKE
D: I'll swing by your house around 7.
N: Mike rises.
C: ALEX
D: I wouldn't go over there. Stan and his Baboons have lunch this period.
C: MIKE
D: Don't worry. I'll see you tonight.
N: Mike strolls over to the Bras' table, plunks himself down.
C: MIKE
D: Did you girls catch Ellen yesterday? Rosie was on. Melissa Etheridge jammed-
E: CONT'D
C: SAMANTHA
D: -You're so rude!? We're not gay. We like boys.
C: JAMIE
D: Yeah, Samantha's a total slu...
N: Samantha's jaw drops.
C: LAUREN
D: Last New Year's Samantha made it with my boyfriend.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I was on like 5 Red Bulls! I can't believe you keep bringing that up.
N: The Bras' begin to bicker amongst themselves. Mike pulls out his new iPhone, plugs the earphones in his ears. The Bras immediately stop bickering, ogle the phone.
C: JAMIE
D: Rad phone.
C: MIKE
D: I know. I'll text you...NOT. Later...much.
N: Mike rises from the table.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Like we'd ever give you our numbers.
N: Stan, carrying a basketball, his goons and Maggie come up behind Mike.
C: STAN
D: Heads up!
N: Stan whips the ball at Mike. Mike, cat-quick, spins around, catches the ball. The whole cafeteria turns their attention on Mike and Stan. Mike points to the name `Stan' on Stan's letter jacket, reads-
C: MIKE
D: Stan. Did mommy sew that on there so you wouldn't forget your name?
N: Laughter from the Students.
C: STAN
D: You think `cause you got a haircut and new clothes people'd forget what a fag you are?
C: MAGGIE
D: Cut it out, Stan. Let's eat.
C: STAN
D: Gimme my ball back, bee-yotch.
N: Mike ignores him and starts dribbling.
C: MIKE
D: You know, Stan, I feel sorry for you.
C: STAN
D: You don't know me.
N: Mike speaks loudly now, playing to the cafeteria.
C: MIKE
D: Oh but I do. All too well. You're the man. Captain of the basketball team. Dates the pretty girls. High school is your kingdom.
N: Stan and his Posse tap fists. Mike dribbles between his legs.
C: MIKE
D: But, People, Stan's a bully. Why? It would be way too easy to say Stan preys on the weak because he's simply a dick. No, Stan's more complex than that. According to leading psychiatrists Stan is a bully for 1 of 3 reasons. 1, under all that male bravado there's an insecure little girl banging on the closet door trying to get out. 2, like a caveman, Stan's brain is underdeveloped. Therefore Stan is unable to use self-control so he acts out aggressively. And the third reason-
E: CONT'D
N: Mike holds up his pinky then spins the ball on it.
C: MIKE
D: I'd argue that Stan suffers from all 3.
E: CONT'D
N: The entire cafeteria LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY. Mike feigns whipping it back at Stan, who recoils, then gently rolls the ball back to Stan.
C: MIKE
D: Don't hurt yourself big boy.
E: CONT'D WINKS
N: Some students, including Alex, ERUPT. The Wonder Bras eye Mike with new found lust. ANGLE ON Mike's face as he walks away.
C: MIKE
D: 3, 2, 1...
E: CONT'D to himself
N: Mike ducks just as the ball whizzes overhead, rockets across the cafeteria landing on Miss Goodwin's tray, splattering her with food. She glares at Stan. Mike's iphone buzzes...ANGLE ON SCREEN: the Wonder Bras digits appear.
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/COLLEGE CENTER - DAY
N: Mike enters, approaches MRS. MENCER, 60.
C: MIKE
D: My guidance councilor made me come, but just so you know I'm not planning on going to college.
C: MRS. MENCER
D: A lot of kids feel that way. Don't be intimidated. It doesn't hurt to take a look.
N: Mrs. Mencer hands Mike a hefty book.
C: MRS. MENCER
D: A good place to start is here... this book has information on every college and university in the country.
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: Thanks.
N: Mike sits, starts paging through the book and gets lost in the bright colored pictures...smiling STUDENTS, CAMPUSES and LECTURE HALLS...THE OPTIONS HE LOST YEARS AGO.
S: INT. ASTON MARTIN - NIGHT
N: A pumped-up Mike dials...ringing. On the seat beside him rests a stack of college applications. Ed answers. ED (o.s.) Hello?
C: MIKE
D: It was incredible! I was incredible! You should'a seen me! I humiliated Stan in front of the entire lunchroom. Everyone was clapping. The popular girls were begging to give me their numbers!
C: ED
D: See what happens when you put a little lipstick on the pig? Did you manage to get sent to the principal's office?
C: MIKE
D: Man, I feel great! I even shot some hoops after school. No aches. No pains. Gotta run, Buddy.
N: Mike hangs up.
S: EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The Aston Martin pulls up. Mike climbs out, walks to the door, takes a deep breath and rings the bell. SCARLET (o.s.) Coming! The door opens revealing Scarlet in her dirty yard attire.
C: SCARLET
D: I've been dying to meet you. I've known your father since...
E: CONT'D gasps
N: Scarlet...SPEECHLESS...visibly stunned by the resemblance...
C: MIKE
D: Is something wrong?
C: SCARLET
D: No. It's just...you look like...No. I'm fine. Come in. Please.
E: FLUSTERED
S: INT. MIKE'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Scarlet and Mike sit across from one another. Scarlet stares at Mike as if examining every pore on his face.
C: SCARLET
D: And you say Ed Freedman is your father?
C: MIKE
D: That's my dad. All 68 inches of him.
C: SCARLET
D: You don't look anything like him. If you don't mind me asking, who's your mother?
C: MIKE
D: My mother...she...she was...a...
N: Mike spies Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment on a table.
C: MIKE
D: -a convict. In New Jersey. They met while dad was at Princeton. She was on parole. B&E, fist fighting, shanking. Nothing major. But she's dead now.
E: CONT'D
C: SCARLET
D: Oh? I'm sorry.
C: MIKE
D: I warned her about kite surfing during hurricane season. So how are things with you? Doing anything exciting? Dating? Flirting with Dom Johnson maybe?
C: SCARLET
D: Why would you ask about Dom? Did Ed tell you to say that?
C: MIKE
D: I mean do what you want. You're a grown woman but, word on the street is Dom's been spreading gingivitis all over town.
C: SCARLET
D: I'll keep that in mind, Mark.
N: Scarlet can't take her eyes off Mike.
C: SCARLET
D: It's crazy how much you like my husband when he was a teenager.
E: CONT'D
N: Mike switches subjects, points to her dirty clothes-
C: MIKE
D: You doing some gardening?
C: SCARLET
D: I am. I'm a landscape designer. I'm actually redoing the backyard. I'll show you.
N: Scarlet stands, leads Mike to the french doors.
C: SCARLET
D: It's a work in progress so you'll have to use your imagination some.
E: CONT'D
N: Scarlet opens the doors, flips on the lights. The yard's been cleaned up. Fresh blankets of sod rest in piles next to stacks of limestone. HUNDREDS of unplanted plants, flowers, trees and shrubs sit around the yard in strategic positions.
S: EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT
N: Mike and Scarlet step outside.
C: MIKE
D: I almost don't even recognize it...er...if I had seen it before I probably wouldn't recognize it.
C: SCARLET
D: You wouldn't have. It was a disaster back here a few days ago. Obviously I have a lot to do still. I'm laying the sod next and the limestone pathway will go here.
N: Scarlet moves about the yard, pointing and explaining.
C: SCARLET
D: Then I'll plant all those, over a hundred different types of flowers and plants. I have an amazing fountain being delivered that'll go here and a bench over there.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: SCARLET
D: And I'll string rows of tiny, white lights above it all so every night will be a starry one. It'll be a real sanctuary back here.
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: It seems like a lot'a work for one person, Scar.
N: A chill runs up Scarlet's spine.
C: SCARLET
D: My husband's the only one that ever calls me that.
N: Alex appears at the doors interrupting-
C: ALEX
D: Yo, Mark. Let's do this.
C: MIKE
D: Good luck with the project.
C: SCARLET
D: Nice to meet you. And, Alex, be home by 10:30.
N: Mike heads back inside. Scarlet stares after him.
S: INT. ASTON MARTIN - NIGHT
N: Mike and Alex step in.
C: MIKE
D: How's your mom doing? You know, with your dad not being around and all.
C: ALEX
D: She doesn't like to show it but I know she's bummed. I think it bothers her more that he hasn't called me or Maggie in a while. Whatever.
N: BEEP. BEEP. Mike pulls out his iPhone, text message from Samantha. It reads:
C: SAMANTHA'S TEXT
D: Wat^? mobinit 2 zuma. soi! but w/e. brb. bk. gtg. ttyl. xo. sam.
N: Mike stares at the screen as if it were in hieroglyphics.
C: MIKE
D: I have no idea what this says?
N: Alex takes the phone from Mike, reads-
C: ALEX
D: It says `What up? Mobbing it to Zuma. So over it but whatever. Be right back. Back. Got to go. Talk to you later. kiss, hug. Sam.
C: MIKE
D: Let's hit the beach, wingman.
N: The two touch fists.
S: EXT. ZUMA BEACH - NIGHT
N: A BONFIRE illuminates the night sky. MUSIC plays. KIDS lay on blankets, play football. Others splash in the ocean. WE find Maggie and the Wonder Bras seated by the fire.
C: SAMANTHA
D: We were on his myspace page. There's a picture of him jamming with the Chili Peppers at Coachella.
C: JAMIE
D: I heard Timbaland wants to produce an album with him.
C: LAUREN
D: Yeah, but he turned him down to help orphans with Brangelina in Nambib-ib-bib...in Africa.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh my God! I bet he knows Justin.
N: ANGLE: Mike and a nervous Alex make their way down the sand.
C: ALEX
D: This looks boring. Let's go back to my house and play video games.
N: Alex turns. Mike grabs his arm, turns him back.
C: MIKE
D: What are you so nervous about?
C: ALEX
D: The beach is for the older, cool kids. I don't belong here.
C: MIKE
D: What are you talking about? You're a basketball player. You're cool.
C: ALEX
D: I don't play basketball. I mean, I can play, I just don't play on the team.
N: Mike is stunned.
C: MIKE
D: But I thought you were getting ready for the season?
C: ALEX
D: I never told you that.
N: As a confused Mike and Alex approach the scene, BOYS call out to Mike, tap his fist. GIRLS fawn over him. Mike's become a celebrity...and he's eating it up. ANGLE: Lauren spots Mike with Alex.
C: LAUREN
D: Here he comes!
N: The Bras whip their heads around, get all dreamy.
C: MAGGIE
D: Can he be any lamer? Using my little brother to get to me?
C: SAMANTHA
D: If that boy was an apple he'd be delicious.
N: Samantha leaps up, scurries over to Mike. Lauren and Jamie chase after her. Maggie shakes her head. As Mike and Alex approach the gathering, Alex freezes up.
C: ALEX
D: Oh, man. It's her. She's here.
C: MIKE
D: Who?
N: Alex nods towards the fire. Seated with FRIENDS is Nicole. Alex BELCHES loudly.
C: ALEX
D: She's so pretty it makes me gassy.
C: MIKE
D: Calm down. Here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna go over there and introduce yourself-
C: ALEX
D: She won't like me, Mark. I'm a loser.
N: Mike grabs Alex by the shoulders.
C: MIKE
D: Why? Because Stan says so? You think Stan's a winner? He's going nowhere. You're a great kid. Any girl would be lucky to get your attention.
C: ALEX
D: Really?
C: MIKE
D: Really. And right now, there's a girl over there who's dying to meet you.
N: A determined look comes over Alex.
C: ALEX
D: Okay. What do I say?
C: MIKE
D: Just introduce yourself. Then compliment her on something she never gets complimented on. Like if she has big, meaty, man hands tell her she should be a hand model. And don't burp on her.
E: Alex burps nervously
C: ALEX
D: I can do that.
N: Alex takes a deep breath, marches off just as Samantha runs up and throws her arms around Mike.
C: SAMANTHA
D: You came! Why don't we take a walk somewhere private and play?
N: Jamie and Lauren rush over.
C: JAMIE
D: I don't think so, Sam. Mark promised me a walk on the beach.
C: LAUREN
D: Walk with me. I've got less miles on me.
N: A full blown ARGUMENT breaks out between the Bras. Mike sees Maggie sitting by the fire alone, slips out. ANGLE: Alex steps over to Nicole and suddenly loses confidence. As he turns to retreat, Nicole looks up-
C: NICOLE
D: Hi.
N: Alex stops, turns back around and blurts out-
C: ALEX
D: Hi, Alex. I'm Nicole.
N: Nicole and her Friends giggle.
C: NICOLE
D: You don't look like a Nicole.
C: ALEX
D: You have big, meaty man hands. You should be a hand model.
N: The Girls' jaws drop. Nicole hides her hands.
C: NICOLE
D: Oh my God! Seriously!?
N: Alex rips a huge BURP. The Girls duck for cover. GIRL 1 I think he got some on me!
C: ALEX
D: Wait. I'm sorry. I'm just real nervous and I've wanted to talk to you for so long. And Mark told me to compliment you on something you never get complimented on but I couldn't find anything because everything's so...perfect.
N: Nicole and her Friends MELT.
C: NICOLE
D: Do you want to sit down, Nicole?
N: Nicole scoots over making room next to her. Alex smiles. ANGLE: Mike sits down beside Maggie.
C: MAGGIE
D: What do you want?
C: MIKE
D: Stan. Why are you dating him?
C: MAGGIE
D: Get to the point why don't you?
C: MIKE
D: I'm serious. He's not a nice guy. Matter of fact he's a jackass.
C: MAGGIE
D: Don't talk about him like that. You don't even know him.
C: MIKE
D: I know he bullies your brother.
C: MAGGIE
D: Stan barely knows Alex exists. We're moving in together after graduation.
C: MIKE
D: Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I thought you were going to Georgetown?
C: MAGGIE
D: I'm going to Westwood Community College. Stan and I both are.
N: Mike loses it, leaps to his feet shouting-
C: MIKE
D: The hell you are, Young Lady! If you think I'm gonna let you throw your life away on some Sleestack you're crazy! I forbid you to see him anymore and that's final!
N: Maggie jumps up. Kids all stare.
C: MAGGIE
D: Who do you think you are!? My father?!
N: Maggie stomps over to the still bickering Bras.
C: MIKE
D: Don't you walk away from me, Margaret Sarah O'Donnell!
N: Maggie and the Bras turn towards Mike and glare. Maggie heads for the parking lot.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Who's Margaret?
C: LAUREN
D: He doesn't even know her name.
C: JAMIE
D: He's so not into her.
N: The Bras make the `text me' sign then hurry after Maggie. Mike kicks angrily at the sand and accidentally into the faces of a group of KIDS.
S: EXT. ED'S HOUSE/POOL - MORNING
N: A HOT GIRL wearing a `Lifeguard' bathing suit sits atop a high chair. Ed floats on a raft. A frozen drink next to him. Scarlet looms over him, the 2 in a heated conversation-
C: SCARLET
D: I haven't heard from him in three weeks. Obviously he doesn't care.
C: ED
D: He cares.
C: SCARLET
D: Then where is he?
N: Mike steps from the house, sees Scarlet-
C: MIKE
D: What's going on?
C: SCARLET
D: Nothing, Mark. I was just dropping something off.
N: Scarlet tosses a manila envelope on the patio table.
C: SCARLET
D: Our court date is the 27th. If he has anything to say, he can say it then.
E: CONT'D
N: Scarlet exits.
C: MIKE
D: What was that all about?
C: ED
D: That envelope contains divorce papers.
N: Mike eyes the envelope, in stunned silence.
C: ED
D: But what do you care? You're going to college, right? Life's one big panty raid for you.
E: CONT'D
N: Mike feigns innocence.
C: MIKE
D: I don't know what you're talking about?
C: ED
D: I saw the applications in your room.
C: MIKE
D: You went through my room!?
C: ED
D: If you'd cleaned like I asked I wouldn't have had to. You can't be serious about this can you?
N: Mike starts to argue then gives in-
C: MIKE
D: I have to face the possibility that I might never turn back and if that's the case, I'm going to do it right this time around.
C: ED
D: Karmically speaking, in the next life you're coming back as a hemorrhoid.
N: Mike scoffs, storms off. Ed calls after him-
C: ED
D: I'm not paying for college!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DAY
N: Mike shoves books in his locker. Stan approaches.
C: STAN
D: You like her, don't you?
C: MIKE
D: Who?
C: STAN
D: My girlfriend. She told me you were trashing me at the beach.
C: MIKE
D: Leave her alone, Stan. She's a good kid.
C: STAN
D: I don't know how good she is yet but after I find out, she's all yours.
N: Stan walks off. Mike slams his locker shut.
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CALCULUS CLASS - DAY
N: Mike slips inside the empty classroom, slathers KRAZY GLUE all over Stan's DESKTOP and CHAIR. Mike sits just as the rest of the class files in. Stan kisses Maggie and takes his seat. Stan leans on his desk, placing a FOREARM and a HAND on the sticky desktop. He catches Mike looking back at him and gives him a cocky wink. Mike winks back knowingly. Mike's phone beeps. He checks it...A PIX MESSAGE...3 perfect ASSES in tiny bikini bottoms. A wide-eyed Mike spins in his seat to find the Wonder Bras smiling at him. Mr. Adams enters.
C: MR. ADAMS
D: Settle, people.
N: Adams scribbles a large equation on the blackboard.
C: MR. ADAMS
D: This was your homework. Who can come up here and solve this for me? Anyone?
E: CONT'D
N: Blank, uninterested faces. Scattered giggles. Adams tosses the chalk angrily on his desk.
C: MR. ADAMS
D: Not one person. Fine. Miss O'Donnell. Come up here and dazzle us with your brilliance.
E: CONT'D
N: Maggie rises nervously from her seat, shuffles to the front of the class. As she passes Stan WE see... Stan lifts his fingers from the desktop...it's WET...he places his wet fingers to the tip of his nose and smells. When Stan tries to remove his fingers from his nose...they STICK. Stan tries to raise his other arm...STUCK.
C: STAN
D: Stuck!!! I'm stuck! My fingers!
N: Stan stands, hunched...the CHAIR GLUED to his butt. The DESK ATTACHED to his forearm and his FINGERS STUCK to his nose. The Kids and Mike burst out laughing, break out their video phones as Stan fumbles around, dragging the desk, PANICKING.
C: MR. ADAMS
D: Sit down, Stan! Sit down!
C: STAN
D: It's glue! I'm glued to everything!
N: Jazz bounds out of his seat, grabs hold of Stan's wrist.
C: JAZZ
D: I'll get it off!

N: RRRRIIIIPPPP. Jazz yanks. Stan's SCREAM echoes.
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - DAY
N: Mike, wearing basketball gear and bouncing a basketball, stands in the middle of the court. Alex enters.
C: ALEX
D: I got your text. What's so important?
C: MIKE
D: This year you're making the team. We practice everyday `til try outs. That gives us a week and a half.
C: ALEX
D: Forget it.
C: MIKE
D: Yeah, you're right. You probably don't have any skills anyway.
N: Mike begins to walk out.
C: ALEX
D: Hey! I got skills.
N: Mike turns back.
C: MIKE
D: So what's your problem? Is it Stan and his friends?
C: ALEX
D: Just leave it alone.
C: MIKE
D: You don't need to be afraid of them, Alex.
C: ALEX
D: I'm too small anyway.
C: MIKE
D: That's why we focus on your speed, dribbling and outside shot. Remember, it's not how big you are-
C: ALEX
D: -it's how big you play. Where did you hear that?
E: QUIZZICALLY
C: MIKE
D: I don't know? Read it somewhere I guess. Be a sport. Show me what you got.
E: COVERS
N: Mike tosses Alex the ball. Alex begins to dribble. Mike steps up to defend. Alex dribbles quicker, through his legs.
C: MIKE
D: Alright. You got a little game.
E: CONT'D
N: WHAM. The doors slam open. In walk Stan and his Posse. A BLOOD speckled BAND-AID covers the tip of Stan's nose.
C: STAN
D: What are you 2 queers doing in my gym?
C: MIKE
D: Let's go, Alex.
N: Alex stops dribbling. He and Mike move towards the door. Stan and his Posse block the way.
C: STAN
D: I don't think so. You girls wanna play with the boys then let's play. 2 on 2.
C: MIKE
D: We'll save you the embarrassment for try-outs.
N: Stan takes the ball from Alex, turns his back, dribbles.
C: STAN
D: Come on, Ally. Embarrass me.
N: While dribbling, Stan moves backwards, bumping into Alex's midsection, forcing Alex back.
C: MIKE
D: Back off, Stan.
N: Alex takes a deep breath, tired of being afraid-
C: ALEX
D: It's okay. I got him.
N: Alex throws his hands up, tries to defend the much bigger Stan. Stan easily backs Alex down, faking left and right.
C: STAN
D: You ready? Here it comes.
N: Stan spins, elbows high...POW...Alex catches one to the head and DROPS. Stan shoots and scores.
C: STAN
D: 2 points! And I was fouled!
E: CONT'D
N: Stan high 5's Jazz and Kevin. Blind with RAGE, Mike RUSHES Stan...WHAM...tackles him hard to the floor. Jazz and Kevin throw Mike off Stan, punching and kicking him. COACH HARVEY, now 58, enters the gym, runs over to the fracas, pulls the boys apart.
C: COACH HARVEY
D: Hey! That's enough! That's enough!
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/OFFICE - DAY
N: Mike and a nervous Alex sit outside the principal's office. Mike holds an ice pack to his eye.

D: My mom's been in there a while. She's gonna be pissed.
C: MIKE
D: Act like you're hurt and she won't be able to stay mad at you.
N: The door swings open. An elated Ed blows in.

N: Ed flashes his pearly whites then blows on Mike. The principal's door opens, an angry Scarlet steps out.
C: SCARLET
D: Ed.
C: ED
D: Hey, Scarlet. Exciting, isn't it? My first parent/principal conference.
N: Scarlet looks sternly to Alex-
C: SCARLET
D: Fighting? What's gotten into you?
C: ALEX
D: I can't talk, Mom. My jaw.
E: rubs his jaw
C: SCARLET
D: My poor baby. And how about you, Mark?

N: Scarlet bends down so she's eye to eye with Mike. She removes the ice pack...a purple shiner.
C: SCARLET
D: Ouch. You poor thing. Does it hurt?
E: CONT'D
N: Scarlet strokes Mike's face. Mike loses himself in her caring, gentle touch.
C: MIKE
D: Not anymore. You smell great.
N: Scarlet, a bit weirded out by Mike, stands.
C: SCARLET
D: Alex, I'll meet you at the car. I need to talk to Uncle Ed for a second.
N: Alex shuffles out of the office. Scarlet turns to Ed, hushed-
C: SCARLET
D: Did you give him the divorce papers?
E: CONT'D
C: ED
D: I sent them to him.
C: SCARLET
D: Is it another woman? I can handle it. Tell me the truth.
C: ED
D: I haven't heard from him, really.
N: Scarlet looks down, fights back tears, unravels a bit...
C: SCARLET
D: Okay. If you do, please have him call home. For the kids...I'm running out of excuses-
C: ED
D: I'll tell him. I promise.
N: Scarlet forces a smile. Mike watches her go. For the first time he's seen HER REALITY...hurt, pain, frustration. Mike places his head sadly in his hands. Julie the Principal pokes her head out the door.
C: JULIE
D: Ed, come on in.
N: Ed whispers to Mike.
C: ED
D: I'll take it from here.
N: As Ed passes Julie on the way in-
C: ED
D: I'm heartbroken. The boy's incorrigible.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Ed takes a seat across from Julie, puts on his best `troubled parent' look.
C: JULIE
D: Look, if it was only one isolated fight it wouldn't distress me all that much. Boys will be boys. But, it's also been brought to my attention that Mark may have Krazy glued a boy to his chair.
N: Ed stifles a laugh, puts on a serious face.
C: ED
D: My son? Mark! Get in here! Now!
N: Mike slouches in, takes a seat.
C: ED
D: Did you glue a boy to his chair?
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: No.
N: Ed throws his hands up in exasperation.
C: ED
D: See? The boy's out of control. He's acting up at home. He won't eat his vegetables-
C: MIKE ED
D: He shaves his back. He sucks his thumb.
C: MIKE ED
D: He wears girls underwear. He wets his bed.
C: JULIE
D: Enough! Mark, I know it's hard to be the new kid but if I have anymore trouble from you, you'll be facing detentions or worse. You can go now.
N: Mike nods, exits. Ed stands and with exaggerated sadness-
C: ED
D: He's crying out for help and I don't know what to do. It hurts so bad. Maybe we could discuss this over margaritas?
C: JULIE
D: Let's give him time to figure it out on his own. If the situation gets worse then we'll take the next step.
C: ED
D: You're the expert. I'm just a single dad out here blowing like dust in the wind.
N: Ed shakes Julie's hand and exits, sniffling.
S: EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY
N: A dirt covered Scarlet wrestles a roll of sod down. MIKE (o.s.) Got an extra pair of gloves? Scarlet peers over her shoulder...Mike wanders in. Scarlet stands, wipes her bare, dirty hands on her jeans.
C: SCARLET
D: Gloves are for sissies.
C: MIKE
D: Yeah, but I just had a manicure.
C: SCARLET
D: You're serious? You want to help?

D: Mark, I'm 36 years old-
C: MIKE
D: I'm just doing this to make a few bucks so I can buy Laker tickets.
C: SCARLET
D: Embarrassing. Sorry. I'll give you 10 dollars a day.
E: BLUSHES
C: MIKE
D: Wow. 10 whole dollars. At that rate I should be able to buy tickets in...2011.
C: SCARLET
D: Fine. 20. Grab a roll.
N: Mike and Scarlet, step over to the sod, lift a roll together, carry it over to the spot.
C: MIKE
D: What are the benefits like here?
C: SCARLET
D: I'll throw in a baloney sandwich.
C: MIKE
D: Deal.
N: Mike and Scarlet share a laugh.
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/LIBRARY - DAY
N: Mike strolls in, sits at a back table, pulls a college application from his knapsack. He takes out a pen, places the tip to the paper where it says `name' when- WE hear the muffled sound of CRYING. Mike rises, follows the sobs through the maze of stacks until he finds-
C: MIKE
D: Maggie?
N: -seated on the floor, head hidden between her knees. Maggie looks up, sees Mike, quickly dries her eyes.
C: MAGGIE
D: What do you want? To rub it in my face? Say I told you so?
C: MIKE
D: You lost me?
N: Maggie drops her head back between her knees.

C: MAGGIE
D: What am I going to do? I can't live without him.
N: Maggie takes Mike's shirt, BLOWS her nose on it.
C: MIKE
D: Maggie, did you two...you know...do...
C: MAGGIE
D: Do what?
C: MIKE
D: That thing...that rabbits do a lot of and that a girl your age should never do and should only do when she's married.
C: MAGGIE
D: Sex? No, that's why he dumped me!
N: Maggie bawls again. Mike silently celebrates, sits beside her, awkwardly pats her on the back.
C: MIKE
D: There, there now. It's okay.
C: MAGGIE
D: Sure he was a jerk but he was there for me. Which is more than I can say for any other man in my life.
N: Maggie sobs uncontrollably. Mike takes a deep breath, calms-
C: MIKE
D: When you're young everything seems like the end of the world. But it's not. It's just the beginning. And you might have to meet a few more jerks, but one day you'll meet a boy who treats you the way you deserve to be treated...like the sun rises and sets with you.
C: MAGGIE
D: You really think so?
C: MIKE
D: I know so.
N: Maggie throws her arms around Mike, hugs him tight. Mike hugs her back. A moment he's never had with his daughter.
C: MAGGIE
D: You're so sweet.
N: ANGLE ON Maggie's face. She's SMITTEN. MONTAGE OF LIFE

C: MIKE
D: No, you don't. Now- -if you don't mind?
E: eyes the toilet

N: Alex types on his phone. Mike enters.
C: MIKE
D: Who you texting?
C: ALEX
D: My dad. I have to tell him about today.

C: ALEX
D: Did you just get a text?
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: Me? No. Yes. It's Ed. I mean dad. Not your dad. My dad. I'll just call him back.

C: ALEX
D: I did it. I'm a Falcon! The first game's in 2 weeks.
C: SCARLET
D: Oh my God, Alex! That's so incredible!
N: Scarlet wraps Alex in a big hug. Mike watches. It's a bittersweet moment for him.
C: SCARLET
D: I'm so happy for you. And now I want to show you guys something.
E: CONT'D
N: Scarlet, unable to contain her excitement, leads Mike and Alex to the french doors and flicks a light switch...
C: SCARLET
D: Ta da!
E: CONT'D
N: Thousands of tiny, white lights illuminate Scarlet's OASIS...
C: MIKE
D: You hung the lights!
C: SCARLET
D: I wanted you to be the first to see it.
C: ALEX
D: Mom, it's sick.
S: EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT
N: The 3 step outside. Mike, truly blown away, takes picture with his iPhone.
C: MIKE
D: It's amazing. I'm speechless. I'm sorry I never saw how talented you are...I mean when people see this and how talented you are you'll be designing sanctuaries all over the city.
C: SCARLET
D: Thank you.
E: BEAMS
C: ALEX
D: Mom, why are you all dressed up?
C: SCARLET

N: Off Mike's stunned reaction.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MIKE'S HOUSE/FOYER - NIGHT
N: Mike marches in behind Scarlet. As they reach the door, he steps in front of her.
C: MIKE
D: Let's see who the lucky guy is.
N: Mike swings the door open revealing...Dom Johnson.
C: MIKE
D: I knew it!
E: CONT'D
N: SLAM. Mike shuts the door, blocks it.
C: MIKE
D: I knew you had a thing for him! You can't do this! You took vows. What kind of example are you setting for the kids!?
E: CONT'D
C: SCARLET
D: Mark, I'm flattered. Really, I am. But I'm too old for you.
N: Scarlet moves Mike aside, opens the door. Dom stands in the doorway holding a bouquet.
C: DOM
D: Wow. You look absolutely ravishing.
C: MIKE
D: Keep it in your pants, Casanova.
C: SCARLET
D: Don't mind him. You all set?
C: DOM
D: Let's do it.
N: Scarlet heads for the van. Dom looks to Mike-
C: DOM
D: Hey, kid...if the vans'a rockin'...well you know the rest.
E: CONT'D
N: Dom imitates humping, jogs after Scarlet.
C: MIKE
D: Don't you lay a finger on her, Johnson! I know where you live!
N: Mike slams the door.
S: INT. MIKE'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: A contemplative Alex scoops lasagna onto plates. An agitated Mike enters, pulls up a seat at the counter.
C: ALEX
D: It's weird to think about my mom with someone other than my dad.
C: MIKE
D: It's adultery! If this were Afghanistan she'd be dragged through the village by goats. You need to talk to her.
C: ALEX
D: My mom's been pretty sad the past few months. She deserves to be happy. My dad obviously is...wherever he is.
C: MIKE
D: Maybe he's not? Maybe he wishes he could be here right now with you but there's a real good reason he can't be.
C: ALEX
D: No, my dad's not a family guy. This is dumb but I used to tell him I was on the basketball team because I knew he'd never make it to a game.
C: MIKE
D: Then why would you tell him that?
C: ALEX
D: I guess I was hoping it would make him like me more.
N: Mike is CRUSHED.
S: INT. GUCCI STORE - DAY
N: Mike paces in front of a dressing room. A SALESMAN waits by the door.
C: MIKE
D: My wife's moving on. My son doesn't think I like him and my daughter's in love with me. I need to change back, Ed.
N: Ed steps from the changing room wearing very tight, ultra hip clothes that belong on a 20 year old...he looks ridiculous.
C: ED
D: What about college?
C: MIKE
D: I'm not going. I'll be a pharm rep til I die. I just want my family back. You're not gonna wear that, are you?
E: BEAT
N: Ed checks his butt in a full length mirror, nods happily.
C: ED
D: Baby's got back.
N: Ed retreats into the changing room. ED (CONT'D) (o.s.) Now that Julie's agreed to go out with me tonight, I need you to start behaving. I can't have her thinking my son is a complete degenerate.
C: MIKE
D: Fine. I want to have some kids over tonight to celebrate Alex making the team. Is that cool?
N: Ed, wearing only his banana hammock underwear and socks, steps from the room, hands the clothes to the Salesman.
C: ED
D: Wrap it up. No, it's not cool. I remember hearing what those parties were like, kids peeing everywhere, food on the ceilings, puke in the pool.
C: MIKE
D: Listen to you. You sound like an old man.
N: Other SHOPPERS eye Ed oddly as they pass.
C: ED
D: No party. I mean it. Don't make me take the car away.
C: MIKE
D: Don't treat me like a child, Ed.
C: ED
D: I won't when you stop acting like one.
N: Mike grabs Ed's bare tits and TWISTS. Ed screams, grabs Mike's tits and TWISTS. Both of them HOWL in pain.
C: SALESMAN
D: Sir! Please!
N: Mike and Ed, both still titty twisting, look up. Everyone in the store stares. They each let go, force smiles.
C: ED
D: This isn't over...son!
C: MIKE
D: Not even close...Dad!
N: Ed stomps into the dressing room rubbing his sore boobs. Mike pulls out his iPhone, begins texting.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DAY
N: The Wonder Bras stand by their lockers when their phones beep...TEXT MESSAGE...
C: MIKE'S TEXT
D: Party at my house 2nite. 7. Get the word out.
N: The Bras type away, simultaneously hit SEND. WIDE REVEALS...hundreds of students...the beeps of hundreds of cell phones.
S: EXT. ED'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: CARS line the street. A steady flow of KIDS stream towards the front door. MUSIC pounds from within. It's a RAGER.
S: INT. ED'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: MAYHEM. Kids raid the refrigerator, throw food around. Another KID sprays the room with the removable sink head. Mike rushes in, grabs the sink head from the Kid.
C: MIKE
D: Give me that!
C: WONDER BRAS
D: Hey, Sexy.
E: O.S.
N: Mike turns without thinking SPRAYING all 3 Wonder Bras in the face. The Bras scream. Mike replaces the nozzle.
C: MIKE
D: I'm so sorry. Have you seen Alex?
N: The Bras wipe themselves off, grab Mike's hands.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Dance with us!
N: The Bras drag a reluctant Mike out of the kitchen and into -
S: INT. ED'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: PARTY-GOERS dance everywhere and on top of everything. The Bras surround Mike, each girl grinding on him as if it were a competition. Lauren takes Mike by the face, turns him towards her-
C: LAUREN
D: Nambib-bib-ib, that African country makes me horny.
N: Jamie spins Mike towards her, places his hands on her boobs-
C: JAMIE
D: Perfect, aren't they?
N: Samantha pulls Mike roughly by the hair, twists him around-
C: SAMANTHA
D: Which one of us is it gonna be?
N: Mike tries to squeeze out. The Bras block him. The music changes...a remix version of Hammer's `Can't Touch This' blares.
C: MIKE
D: I thought you girls wanted to dance?
N: Mike breaks into the 80's Hammer routine WE saw from the first scene. The Bras back up. Party-Goers stop what they're doing and watch...not sure whether to laugh or join in. And then, the Bras fall in. Followed by others. The party just got hotter. Maggie runs through the party and out the back. Stan chases after her. Mike inconspicuously Hammer walks his way out of the mix and outside.
S: EXT. ED'S HOUSE/POOL - NIGHT
N: Stan corners Maggie against the back wall.
C: STAN
D: I was upset. I'm sorry. But I need you to show me you love me. Then we'll move in together.
C: MAGGIE
D: Whatever. I'm with someone else now.
C: STAN
D: Yeah, right. Who'd be stupid enough?
C: MAGGIE
D: Him.
N: Stan turns angrily toward Mike as he approaches.
C: MIKE
D: Party's over, Stan. You're out of here.
C: STAN
D: Who's gonna make me leave? You?
C: MIKE
D: I would but it smells like you've been drinking so I'll let the cops do it.
N: Mike pulls out his phone. Stan looks to Maggie then back to Mike, laughs-
C: STAN
D: You can have the nun. She doesn't put out anyway.
C: MIKE
D: On second thought-
N: Mike SWINGS. Stan ducks, throws a giant uppercut. POW. Mike's eyes roll back in his head and WE cut to BLACK.
S: INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT/DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: The HOSTESS shows Ed and Julie to their table by the window. Ed wears his new Gucci outfit. Julie's under dressed.
C: HOSTESS
D: There you are, Mr. Freedman.
C: ED
D: Thanks. Put this towards your studies.
N: Ed hands the Hostess a 50. Julie rolls her eyes.
C: JULIE
D: When you asked me to get together to talk about Mark this isn't what I envisioned. This isn't a date, Ed.
C: ED
D: Are you insinuating that I'd use my son's misfortune just to go out with you? What kind of a father do you think I am?
C: JULIE
D: As long as we're on the same page.
N: A WAITER approaches.
C: WAITER
D: Good evening. Would you care to see the wine-
C: ED
D: Bring us the 1962 Petrus.
N: The Waiter nods, leaves.
C: ED
D: You're going to love this wine. $2000 dollars a bottle.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: I don't drink. So tell me what you think's going on with Mark?
C: ED
D: It's baffling really but I noticed he's been drinking a lot of diet ice tea lately. Maybe he's gay?
C: JULIE
D: You didn't ask me here to talk about Mark, did you?
C: ED
D: Do you like caviar? Because if you do you have to try the Almas. 100 year-old Beluga. $700 per ounce.
N: Julie throws her napkin on the table.
C: JULIE
D: You're disgusting, Ed.
C: ED
D: What? You don't like Beluga? You can get something else.
C: JULIE
D: I'm not some 22 year-old who you can impress with caviar and expensive wine.
C: ED
D: Would the caviar and expensive wine impress you if you were on a yacht off Monte Carlo?
C: JULIE
D: I came here because I'm concerned about the wellbeing of your son but you don't care about Mark. All you're concerned with is proving to me how wealthy you are.
C: ED
D: I do care about Mike...Mark. Whatever his name is.
C: JULIE
D: You know what's too bad, Ed? I'm sure when you were the guy the boys picked on and the girls ignored you were really sweet.
E: MORE
C: JULIE
D: But you thought becoming rich would solve all your problems. Instead it made you just like them. I have to go.
E: CONT'D
N: Julie rises. Ed takes her wrist.
C: ED
D: Wait. You're right. I'm acting like an idiot. I'm sorry. Please stay.
N: Julie begrudgingly sits back down.
C: JULIE
D: Act normal or I'm leaving.
S: INT. ED'S HOUSE/MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: CLOSE ON Mike's face, eyes shut. A hand gently strokes his head. Mike stirs awake, smiles, eyes still closed-
C: MIKE
D: I had the craziest dream. I was 17 again and back in high school. It was horrible, Scarlet-
N: MAGGIE (o.s.) Scarlet!? Mike's eyes pop open. WIDER reveals Mike and Maggie on the bed. Mike's head rests on Maggie's lap. Mike JUMPS off the bed, scrambles to the other side of the room and behind a chair. Maggie leaps off the bed.
C: MAGGIE
D: You wanna play? Okay, let's play. I'm the hungry lioness and you're a baby gazelle.
E: CONT'D
N: Maggie ROARS, chases Mike around the room.
C: MIKE
D: Wait! This is highly inappropriate and dysfunctional. Listen to me, Maggie. I'm your father.
N: Maggie growls, stalks Mike around the bed.
C: MAGGIE
D: And I've been a bad, bad girl, Daddy.
N: Maggie dives across the bed. Mike dodges, runs out the door.
S: EXT. ED'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT
N: Alex and Nicole sit closely by a fire pit, laughing.
C: ALEX
D: How about Mrs. Cruz? Every time she rolls her r's she spits all over me.
N: Alex imitates Mrs. Cruz. Nicole laughs, places her hand on Alex's leg. Alex looks down at her hand, then up at her, both staring at one another...THE MOMENT. Nicole closes her eyes, moves in. Alex moves in then FREAKS. He bounds out of his chair, sprints inside leaving Nicole hanging.
S: INT. ED'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: A distraught Alex pushes his way through the insanity. He finds Mike running down the stairs.
C: ALEX
D: Mike, I blew it! I totally blew it!
C: MIKE
D: Blew what? What happened?
C: ALEX
D: She wanted me to kiss her but I panicked. I didn't know if I should close my eyes or which way to turn my head or how much tongue I'm supposed to use-
C: MIKE
D: Slow down. Have you ever kissed a girl before?
C: ALEX
D: Not a real one. I used to practice on my dad's Playboys.
C: MIKE
D: How did you find...forget it. It's easy. All you have to do is take her face in your hands gently like THIS-
N: Mike places a hand gently on either side of Alex's face.
C: MIKE
D: -hold her still as you adjust your head, close your eyes and kiss her. The rest happens naturally.
E: CONT'D
N: A BOY walks past, sees Mike romantically holding Alex's face.
C: BOY
D: That is so wrong.
N: Mike and Alex quickly separate.
C: ALEX
D: What if I, you know, pitch a tent?
C: MIKE
D: If you feel it, you know, getting angry, take a step back. Now go get that kiss.
N: Alex takes a deep breath, steps outside.
S: EXT. ED'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT
N: A determined Alex marches over to the seated Nicole.
C: ALEX
D: Nicole.
N: Nicole stands-
C: NICOLE
D: I'm sorry, Alex. I didn't mean to-
N: Before she can finish Alex's hands are on her face and his lips on hers. It's as if time stands still.
S: INT. ED'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Mike watches his son's MAGICAL FIRST KISS. And when Alex takes a step back, Mike laughs. BEEP. BEEP. Mike pulls out his phone. Text message.
C: SAMANTHA'S TEXT

N: The chance of a lifetime. A legend making moment.
C: MIKE
D: Girls, if I was 20 years younger I'd...probably only last 10 seconds anyway. Put your clothes back on.
E: looks sadly at the Bras
N: Mike turns, exits. On the way out WE actually hear SNIFFLING.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Was he crying?
S: INT. UPSCALE RESTAURNT - NIGHT
N: Julie laughs hysterically.
C: ED
D: God's honest truth. I had the whole costume. I used to go everywhere dressed like a wizard. No wonder I didn't get a date all through high school. Annnnd you think I'm the biggest nerd ever.
C: JULIE
D: No, no, really. I don't. Hark! Who goes there?
E: catches her breath, suddenly serious
C: ED
D: Tis I. The Wizard they call Marius. And who might you be fair maiden?
E: UNSURE
N: Free to be herself, Julie lets her hair down, shakes it out.
C: JULIE

C: ED JULIE
D: NO WAY! YES WAY!

D: How did you get your hands on the 5th edition? That's not due out for another three years.
C: ED
D: I have two words for you. Russian mafia.
C: JULIE
D: Drive faster.
N: He steps on the gas. He fishtails around a corner. Cars pack Ed's street and driveway. Boys and girls trample the front lawn. One BOY urinates in a flower bed.
C: JULIE
D: Calm thyself, Marius.
E: CONT'D
C: ED
D: That little-! I'll kill him!
N: Ed double parks the car, jumps out.
S: EXT. ED'S HOUSE - NIGHT

N: All the Kids on the lawn SCATTER in different directions.
S: INT. ED'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Ed and Julie enter the crowded, loud room. Kids dance, stomp around on the furniture. A furious Ed screams-

C: JULIE
D: This party is over! If you don't want to spend the next 3 months in detention you will leave...now!
N: The Kids BEELINE for the door. Ed stops a GIRL.
C: ED
D: Do you know where Mark Freedman is?
C: GIRL

S: INT. ED'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Maggie enters, weeds through the crowd, bumps into the Bras.
C: MAGGIE
D: Have you seen Mark?

N: Maggie scowls, heads for the back door. The Bras chase.
S: EXT. ED'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT
N: Mike and Scarlet hide behind the pool house, peek around the corner, spy on Alex and Nicole by the fire pit. Alex is animated, confident...
C: SCARLET
D: He's like a totally different person.
N: Scarlet and Mike step back by the pool, sit on a lounge.
C: SCARLET
D: It's been so good for him to have you around. You have no idea.
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: Believe me, I do. He's a great kid. And you're an amazing mother.
C: SCARLET
D: I'm not so sure. I mean look at me. I showed up at a party to drag my son home. Could I be any more embarrassing? And how many amazing mothers run their kids' father off?
C: MIKE
D: Hey, you didn't run him off. Don't blame yourself for his stupidity.
C: SCARLET
D: I knew he was unhappy. I knew he hated his job. I should've been more supportive, more sympathetic to what he was going through. He gave up a lot for me.
C: MIKE
D: That's bull shit! You, Maggie and Alex are the best thing that ever happened to me...him. He was just too selfish to recognize it. At least, that's how I see it.
N: Scarlet smiles thankfully at Mike. ANGLE...Maggie and the Bras roam the backyard searching for Mike.
C: JAMIE
D: He's over there. By the pool.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Who's the ho?
C: MAGGIE
D: Mom?
N: ANGLE...Alex and Nicole, hand in hand, stroll back towards the house when Alex freezes-
C: ALEX
D: Whoa. What's my mom doing here?
N: ANGLE...Scarlet places a hand over Mike's.
C: SCARLET
D: You're sweet. I have no idea why I'm telling you all this. There's just something so familiar...
N: Scarlet looks into Mike's eyes. Mike stares back. She's vulnerable. He loves her. It's perfect. Mike leans in and KISSES HER...PASSIONATELY. SSSSSLAP. Mike falls off the chair. Scarlet leaps up.
C: SCARLET
D: What do you think you're doing!?
E: CONT'D
N: Mike scrambles to his feet.
C: MIKE
D: Scar, just calm down. I have something to tell you but I need you to keep an open mind. Can you do that for me?
C: SCARLET
D: This conversation is over, Mark.
C: MIKE
D: I'm not Mark.
C: SCARLET
D: I'm not in the mood for games.
C: MIKE
D: It's no game. I'm me...him...Mike. It's me...your husband.
N: Scarlet winces as if dealt a blow-
C: SCARLET
D: What? Why would you say that?
C: MIKE
D: It's the truth. I'm the father of your children. You have to believe me.
C: SCARLET
D: Don't ever come near me or my family again. If you do, I'll have you arrested or better yet, institutionalized.
N: Scarlet marches towards the house. Mike on her heels pleading.
C: MIKE
D: Let me explain, Scar.
N: As she passes Ed and Julie.
C: SCARLET
D: Your son needs a shrink!
N: Scarlet storms off. Before Mike can protest-
C: MAGGIE
D: Pervert!
N: Mike turns. SLAP. Maggie lights him up, runs for the house. SLAP, SLAP, SLAP. The Bras add theirs on the way out. Alex and Nicole march past. Mike reaches for Alex's arm. Alex pulls it away.
C: MIKE
D: Alex, wait. Let me explain-
C: ALEX
D: How could you do this to me?
N: Alex whisks Nicole into the house. Mike lowers his head. Ed stomps over, grabs Mike.
C: ED
D: This place is a disaster! A kid pissed all over my English garden! What were you thinking!?
C: MIKE
D: She hates me, Ed. I've ruined everything.
N: Mike runs for the house. Julie looks quizzically to Ed.
C: JULIE
D: Who hates him? What's going on?
N: Ed shifts uncomfortably, takes a deep breath.
C: ED
D: Oh boy. I don't quite know how to put this.
C: JULIE
D: Try being honest.
C: ED
D: He's not really my son. I don't have a son.
N: SLAP. Ed looks like he's about to cry.
C: JULIE
D: Mark's obviously having a crisis and you...you insensitive bastard, you disown him? He'd be better off with his mother in Thailand.
N: Julie strides for the house. Ed yells after her-

D: Should I call you?!

C: ED
D: Are you alright?
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: I really messed up. I've lost my family.
C: ED
D: That's not true. Nothing's ever truly lost.
C: MIKE
D: What about you and Julie?
C: ED
D: Oh, that? That's lost.
C: MIKE
D: Sorry about the party. I'll pay for any damages.
C: ED
D: Don't worry about it. My spa guy got the last of the vomit out of the pool so we're good. I don't mean to rub salt in your wounds but-
N: Ed holds up the manila envelope of divorce papers.
C: ED
D: -you're due in court in an hour.
E: CONT'D
N: A look of determination comes over Mike's face.

S: EXT. LOS ANGELES COURT HOUSE - DAY
N: Ed's BMW skids to a stop in front of the building. Mike and Ed bound out, race up the court steps-

D: I am legal counsel for Mike O'Donnell and I demand a stay of execution for this marriage, your Majesty.
C: SCARLET
D: He's my husband's best friend.
C: JUDGE
D: Are you a lawyer, best friend?
C: ED
D: No but I have been a defendant in numerous lawsuits so-
C: JUDGE
D: Bailiff! Get these 2 out of my courtroom.
N: The Bailiff grabs Mike and a yelling Ed, drags them toward the exit. Mike wiggles free, runs back to the front.
C: MIKE
D: Your Honor! I have a letter from Mike O'Donnell. Just let me read it. Please.
C: JUDGE
D: I'm sorry, but-
C: SCARLET
D: If it's okay, your Honor. I'd like to hear it.
C: JUDGE
D: Make it quick.
N: Mike digs into his pocket, pulls out a piece of paper.
C: MIKE
D: Thank you, your Honor. September 7th, 1988 was the first time I saw you. You were reading `The Great Gatsby' and wearing a Guns N Roses T-shirt. I'd never seen anything so perfect. I remember thinking I had to have you or I'd die...not in a psycho kinda way but in that beautiful, innocent, unaffected way that way only a 17 year-old kid can have. You whispered you loved me at the homecoming dance and I felt so peaceful and safe because I knew no matter what happened from that night on nothing could ever be that bad because I had you. And then I grew up, lost my way and blamed you for my failures. But I was never lost. I'd just forgotten the way life makes you forget as you grow older. And I never failed at anything because on that September day you said `yes' to me. And at that dance you said you loved me. And as I stand here...as I write this, I want you to know if I don't have you I'll die...not in a psycho way but in that beautiful, innocent, unaffected way only a 17 year old kid can have....oh and...P.S...I'm `Hungry Like the Wolf'.
E: READS
N: Mike places the PAPER ON THE TABLE, looks over to Scarlet. Scarlet just stares at him, tears streaming down her cheeks...sadness...recognition?
C: JUDGE
D: Alright, son, you have to go now.
N: Mike nods, walks down the aisle and out the door.
C: JUDGE
D: Let's proceed.
E: CONT'D
C: SCARLET
D: Your Honor, Sir. I'm sorry. I'm in no shape...I need to postpone...I'm sorry.
N: A tearful Scarlet starts to leave, stops, picks up Mike's `letter'...DIRECTIONS TO THE COURTHOUSE. She looks back confused.
S: INT. BMW CONVERTIBLE - DAY
N: A solemn Mike stares out the window. Ed turns the radio off.
C: ED
D: Maybe it wasn't a spell of enlightenment.
N: Mike looks to Ed.
C: MIKE
D: What are you talking about?
C: ED
D: According to the website once you've learned your lesson you'd turn back. That speech should've broken the spell.
C: MIKE
D: Enough with the magic crap, Ed.
C: ED
D: You know what this means? You need to let them go. You need to let them get on with their lives and you need to get on with yours.
N: Mike chokes back tears...because he knows Ed is right.
S: INT. ED'S HOUSE/MIKE'S BEDROOM - DUSK
N: Mike works on his laptop, plugs his iPhone into it...downloads pictures. Mike moves to the bed, packs his Falcons uniform into a duffel bag. A BEEP. Mike unplugs the iPhone, types an email to Scarlet, "I think this will help your business. Best of luck, Mark" Mike hits send, grabs his bag and exits.
S: EXT. ED'S HOUSE - DUSK
N: Mike steps outside, throws his duffel into the Aston. Ed exits the house.
C: ED
D: Where you going?
C: MIKE
D: I'm moving on. See you at the game.
N: Mike climbs into the car, pulls out of the driveway.
S: INT. MIKE'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - DUSK
N: Scarlet sits at the kitchen table working on her laptop. The noise of an incoming email. She clicks over...MARK FREEDMAN. Scarlet reads Mike's email then clicks on the link. A web site pops up...`Scarlet's Sanctuaries'. Scarlet smiles.
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - NIGHT
N: An empty gym. Mike stands feet beyond the 3 point line, grabs balls from a hopper and rapidly shoots, shoots, shoots. SWISH...SWISH...SWISH. Automatic. Coach Harvey enters.
C: COACH HARVEY
D: Hey, Freedman, save some for the game.
N: Mike sinks one last jumper, turns to the coach.
C: MIKE
D: Just warming up, Coach.
N: Coach Harvey hands Mike a towel.
C: COACH HARVEY
D: Son, I haven't seen anyone with your shooting ability in, well, in a long time. I called a couple college scouts I know. They're coming to the game tonight...to watch you. If you have half the season I think you're capable of, you can play anywhere you want.
C: MIKE
D: That's the plan, Coach.
N: The rest of the Falcons basketball team jogs out from the locker room followed by a PHOTOGRAPHER.
C: COACH HARVEY
D: Round up, Jock Straps! Picture time.
N: The Team assembles in the middle of the court. Alex moves away from Mike. A PLAYER kneeling in front holds a sign, `FITCH FALCONS, 2008.'
C: PHOTOGRPAHER
D: 3, 2, 1-
N: FLASH. And with the flash WE cut to:
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - LATER
N: A POPULAR SONG rocks the gymnasium. CHEERLEADERS dance on the sidelines. STUDENTS and PARENTS cheer wildly from the packed stands. Julie gabs with a group of TEACHERS. On one end of the court, the Falcons run a pass and shoot drill. On the opposite end, a TEAM in BLUE shoots around. Mike sees Scarlet and Maggie enter. He smiles apologetically to them. Both turn away, climb the bleachers, join Nicole and the Wonder Bras.
C: MAGGIE
D: I thought he was hanging out with Alex to get to me- not you.
E: to Scarlet
N: ANGLE...Coach Harvey claps loudly-
C: COACH HARVEY
D: Alright, Ladies, bring it in!
N: The Falcons swarm the bench, take their seats. Mike takes a deep breath, sits next to Alex. Alex looks down.
C: MIKE
D: ALEX-
C: ALEX
D: I have nothing to say to you.
C: MIKE
D: I never meant to hurt you-
C: ALEX
D: Then why'd you kiss my mom!?
C: MIKE
D: Alex, I'm your fa...I don't know. I'm sorry.
N: Alex stands-
C: ALEX
D: You're lucky I don't punch you out.
N: Alex moves down the line, takes another seat. Ed strides through the door spots Julie, makes his way over to her.
C: ED
D: Julie, can I talk to you?
N: Julie excuses herself from the Teachers.
C: JULIE
D: What is it, Ed?
C: ED
D: I've seen a good friend of mine lose everything that means anything to him. And maybe we'll never be there but...I just really want to play D & D with you.
N: Julie can't help but smile, sizes Ed up.
C: JULIE
D: You can raid my dungeon anytime.
C: ED
D: I'll bring my long bow.
N: A REFEREE blows his whistle.
C: COACH HARVEY
D: Let's go! Remember, Boys, winners get the girls. Losers please themselves!
N: Mike and the Falcons jog onto the court. Mike takes his place for the jump ball. The Crowd stomps, cheers LOUDLY. Mike looks around the gymnasium...it almost seems to SLOW UP...the sound deafening. He finds Alex on the bench...his hopeful face. Mike looks into the stands...Maggie and Scarlet. Scarlet abruptly stands, climbs back down the bleachers and exits the gym. The Ref readies to toss the ball. Mike takes a deep breath...and walks off the court.
C: REFEREE
D: Son! Come back here! You're gonna get a delay of game!
C: COACH HARVEY
D: This can't be happening again.
N: Mike steps over to Alex-
C: MIKE
D: It's your turn now. Good luck.
N: Mike rushes off the court. As Mike disappears into the tunnel, WE see the OLD JANITOR amongst the crowd. He smiles. Coach Harvey turns to Alex-
C: COACH HARVEY
D: Get off your butt, O'Donnell! Get in there!
N: Alex leaps off the bench.
S: INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/TUNNEL - NIGHT
C: MIKE
D: Scar!
N: The tunnel is EMPTY. Crestfallen, Mike lowers his head... ANGLE ON: Scarlet as she appears at the far end of the tunnel.
C: SCARLET
D: What took you so long?
N: ANGLE ON: Mike and he's 36 years-old again, bursting out of his uniform.
C: MIKE
D: The best choice I ever made was you.
N: Scarlet and Mike walk towards one another, picking up their pace the closer they get.
C: SCARLET
D: How did this happ-
N: Mike wraps his arms around her.
C: MIKE
D: Don't ask.
N: They lock lips. Mike takes Scarlet's hand and as they walk out of the tunnel-
C: MIKE
D: I think it's best if we don't tell the kids about this. Especially Maggie.
E: CONT'D
N: THE END
