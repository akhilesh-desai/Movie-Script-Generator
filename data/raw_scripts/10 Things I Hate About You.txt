M: 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU
N: written by Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith transcription by GarethGarethGareth@yahoo.com based loosely on “Taming of the Shrew", by William Shakespeare Well, here it is: The complete transcription of 10 Things I Hate About You from the movie itself. The original script available on the web is about as similar to the final movie as Rocky Balboa is to Rocky the Squirrel. So, by gum, somebody had to get it right. Text found in [brackets] indicates moments where I’ve guessed what the characters are saying, due to mumbling, or my own lack of hearing, or both. - Gareth
S: EXT. PADUA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
N: Welcome to Padua High, your typical upper-middle-class high school in Seattle, Washington.
S: EXT. PADUA HIGH SCHOOL, THE STREET OUTSIDE - DAY
N: Two cookie-cutter-cute girls sing along in their car to a bit of popular fluff music. KAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be (and failing) -- pulls her rundown car up next to theirs and scowls with indignation at their choice of music.
S: EXT. PADUA HIGH SCHOOL, FRONT STEPS- DAY
N: Kat hurries toward the front door of what appears to be the Wayne Manor version of an ordinary high school. She approaches another cookie-cutter-cutie pasting an advert for prom on the wall, and tears it down in passing.
C: PROM POSTER GIRL
D: Hey!
S: INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
N: CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going new kid at school with an optimistic, innocent face, sits facing MISS PERKY, a conservative spinster stereotype turned on its head. She’s in the middle of composing some racy lines from her pulp romance-novel-in-progress on her laptop.
C: MISS PERKY
D: So, Cameron. Here you go. 9 schools in 10 years, my my... Army brat?
E: reviews his transcript
C: CAMERON
D: Yeah. My dad’s a...
C: MISS PERKY
D: That’s enough. I'm sure you won't find Padua any different than your old school. Same little asswipe shit-for-brains everywhere.
C: CAMERON
D: Excuse me. Did you just say... Am I in the right office?
C: MISS PERKY
D: Not anymore you’re not. I’ve got deviants to see and a novel to finish. Now scoot. Scoot!
C: CAMERON
D: Okay. Thanks.
N: Cameron rises to leave and passes PATRICK VERONA, a smug, longhaired Australian, who’s on his way in. Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick
C: MISS PERKY
D: Patrick Verona. I see we're making our visits a weekly ritual.
E: continuing
N: She gives him a disapproving glance. He answers with a charming smile.
C: PATRICK
D: Only so we can have these moments together. Should I, uh, get the lights?
C: MISS PERKY
D: Oh very clever, kangaroo boy. Says here you exposed yourself in the cafeteria?
C: PATRICK
D: I was joking with the lunch lady. It was a bratwurst.
C: MISS PERKY
D: Bratwurst? Aren’t we the optimist? Next time keep it in your pouch, okay? Scoot!
E: glances at his loins suspiciously
N: After he leaves, she goes back to writing her novel, adding the word “bratwurst” to the sentence she's working on.
S: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
N: MICHAEL ECKMAN, a typical, overachieving, brainy senior with a young republican’s sense of style, introduces himself to Cameron among the bustle of the hall.
C: MICHAEL
D: Michael Eckman. I’m supposed to show you around.
C: CAMERON
D: Oh hi. Thank God! You know, normally they send down one of those audio/video geeks.
E: seems relieved
C: MICHAEL
D: You know, I do. I know what you mean, yeah.
E: flustered
N: An audio/video geek pushing a cart full of film equipment rolls along side them.
C: A/V GEEK
D: Hey Michael, where should I put those slides?
C: MICHAEL
D: Michael?! So, uh, ...Cameron. Here’s the breakdown:
E: brushes off the A/V Geek Turns back to Cameron checks a piece of paper
N: They begin to walk down the hallway.
C: MICHAEL
D: Over there you’ve got your basic beautiful people. Now listen. Unless they talk to you first, don’t bother.
E: Continuing
C: CAMERON
D: But wait. Is that your rule or theirs?
C: MICHAEL
D: Watch. Hey there.
E: To an ironically not very good looking jock as they pass
C: JOCK
D: Geek.
C: MICHAEL
D: See that?
E: To Cameron
N: The Jock and his friends glare as if offended as the two walk away.
S: EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY
N: Groups of students stand around. Michael and Cameron continue their walk.
C: MICHAEL
D: To the left we have the coffee kids.
E: Continuing
N: COFFEE KID 1 Whoa! (spills his coffee) COFFEE KID 2 That was Costa Rican, butthead!
C: MICHAEL
D: Very edgy. Don’t make any sudden moves around them.
N: They step down and pass a table full of white boys with dreadlocks and prerequisite Jamaican berets.
C: MICHAEL
D: And these delusionals are the White Rasta. Uh, they’re big Marley fans. They think they're black. Semi-political, but mostly...
C: CAMERON
D: Smoke a lot of weed?
C: MICHAEL
D: Yeah.
N: They now approach a few kids dressed as urban cowboys.
C: MICHAEL
D: These guys...
E: continuing
C: CAMERON
D: Wait wait. Let me guess. Cowboys?
C: MICHAEL
D: Yeah but, the closest they’ve come to a cow is Macdonald’s. Hah hah...Macdonalds!
E: laughs at his own lame joke
N: They approach a group of studious-looking teens who are bent over textbooks at a table.
C: MICHAEL
D: These are your future MBAs- We're all Ivy League accepted. Yuppie greed is back, my friend. Hey guys. How ya doin’?
E: to the group
N: One of them looks annoyed and mutters something about “Bogie”. It is, in fact BOGIE LEVENSTEIN himself, leader of the academic geeks. Why does he mutter his own name? Maybe he just likes to speak in the third person...
C: MICHAEL
D: Yesterday I was their god.
E: continuing as they walk away
C: CAMERON
D: What happened?
C: MICHAEL
D: Bogie Levenstein started a rumor that I...that I buy my Izods at an outlet mall.
C: CAMERON
D: So they kicked you out?
C: MICHAEL
D: Hostile takeover. But don’t worry. They’ll pay. Now over here...
C: CAMERON
D: Oh my god!
E: Suddenly distracted
N: BIANCA, a young cream puff of a blonde girl, walks by in slow motion. Cameron is in deep smit.
C: CAMERON
D: What group is she in?
E: Continues
C: MICHAEL
D: The “don’t even think about it” group. That’s Bianca Stratford. A sophomore.
C: CAMERON
D: I burn! I pine! I perish!
C: MICHAEL
D: Of course you do. You know, she’s beautiful and deep. Pure.
N: Bianca walks with her friend, CHASTITY, a cute and seemingly less loquacious version of herself.
C: BIANCA
D: Yup, see, there’s a difference between “like” and “love”. Because I like my Sketchers, but I love my Prada backpack.
C: BIANCA’S FRIEND
D: But I love my Sketchers.
C: BIANCA
D: That’s because you don’t have a Prada backpack.
C: BIANCA’S FRIEND
D: Ohhh!
E: Enamored of Bianca’s wisdom
C: MICHAEL
D: Listen. Forget her. Incredibly uptight father, and it’s a widely known fact that the Stratford sisters aren’t allowed to date.
E: To Cameron
C: CAMERON
D: Uh huh...yeah. [What if?]
S: INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
N: A room full of bored seniors doodle and stare off into space. MR. MORGAN, an educated, no-nonsense man in his early thirties presides.
C: MR. MORGAN
D: Okay then. What did everyone think of The Sun Also Rises?
N: A girl raises her hand and offers her appraisal.
C: ROMANTIC GIRL
D: I loved it. It was sooo romantic.
E: She sighs
N: Kat, the girl we saw as we entered the school, is wearing a camo top in preparation for her daily war against high school ignorance.
C: KAT
D: Romantic? Hemingway?! He was an abusive alcoholic misogynist who squandered half his life hanging around Picasso trying to nail his leftovers.
E: disgusted
N: The other students roll their eyes. JOEY DONNER, a slicked-back knock-off of Slater from Saved By The Bell makes fun of her from his row.
C: JOEY
D: As opposed to a bitter self-righteous hag who has no friends?
N: A few giggles. Kat fumes from her seat without looking back.
C: MR. MORGAN
D: Pipe down, Chachie.
C: KAT
D: I guess in this society being male and an asshole makes you worthy of our time. What about Sylvia Platt or Charlotte Bronte or Simone de Beauvoir?
N: Patrick suddenly steps into the classroom, late.
C: PATRICK
D: What’d I miss?
C: KAT
D: The oppressive patriarchal values that dictate our education.
C: PATRICK
D: Good.
E: immediately turns and leaves
C: MR. MORGAN
D: Hey, hey!
E: Shouting after him
C: JOEY
D: Uh, Mr. Morgan. Is there any chance we could get Kat to take her Mydol before she comes to class?
N: More snickers from the class.
C: MR. MORGAN
D: Some day you’re gonna get bitch-slapped and I’m not gonna do a thing to stop it. And Kat. I want to thank you for your point of view.
N: She smiles to herself, her social indignation justified.
C: MR. MORGAN
D: I know how difficult it must be for you to overcome all those years of upper middle class suburban oppression. It must be tough.
E: continuing
N: She deflates and becomes bitter again.
C: MR. MORGAN
D: But the next time you storm around the PTA crusading for better lunch meat, or whatever it is you white girls complain about, ask them why they can’t buy a book written by a black man!
E: continuing
N: Two of the White Rasta kids from earlier take up his cry of inequality.
C: WHITE RASTA CHORUS
D: That’s right mon!
C: MR. MORGAN
D: Don’t even get me started on you two!
N: They grumble apologetically and quickly shut up. Kat is fuming again.
C: KAT
D: Anything else?
C: MR. MORGAN
D: Yeah. Go to the office. You’re pissing me off.
C: KAT
D: What?! Mr. Morgan!
C: MR. MORGAN
D: Later!
N: Kat gets up in a tiff and on her way out hits Joey in the face with her books.
S: INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Miss Perky sits in front of her laptop, composing her sleazy novel.
C: MISS PERKY
D: Undulating with desire, Adrienne removes her crimson cape... ...excitable, stiff and... Judith!
E: frustrated, calls to attendant
N: Judith appears at the door.
C: MISS PERKY
D: What’s another word for...engorged?
C: JUDITH
D: I’ll look it up.
C: MISS PERKY
D: Okay.
E: returns to composing
N: Kat approaches the office and overhears Miss Perky searching for the right word.
C: MISS PERKY
D: ...swollen...turgid...
E: continuing
C: KAT
D: Tumescent?
C: MISS PERKY
D: Perfect! So I hear you were terrorizing Mr. Morgan‘s class. Again.
C: KAT
D: Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
C: MISS PERKY
D: The way you expressed your opinion to Bobby Ridgeway? By the way, his testicle retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
C: KAT
D: I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.
C: MISS PERKY
D: The point is Kat...
N: She suddenly makes the connection between Kat’s name and the picture of a cat on her coffee mug. She finds it amusing and points to the mug.
C: MISS PERKY
D: Cat! People perceive you as somewhat ...
E: She giggles, then turns back to Kat
C: KAT
D: Tempestuous?
C: MISS PERKY
D: "Heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
N: Kat is unflattered.
C: MISS PERKY
D: You might want to work on that. Thank you.
E: continuing
N: Kat rises from her chair.
C: KAT
D: As always, thank you for your excellent guidance. I’ll let you get back to Reginald’s quivering member.
E: sarcastic
N: Kat leaves the office.
C: MISS PERKY
D: Quivering member... I like that.
E: to herself
S: EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY
N: Joey and his COHORT, a tough-looking kid, are standing around people watching. His Cohort notices Bianca and Chastity entering the courtyard and calls Joey’s attention to Bianca.
C: COHORT
D: Virgin alert. [Favorite].
N: Joey turns to look at Bianca. The girls pass by, noticing Joey.
C: JOEY
D: Looking good, ladies.
C: COHORT
D: They’re outta reach, even for you.
C: JOEY
D: No one’s out of reach for me.
C: COHORT
D: You wanna put money on that?
C: JOEY
D: Money I’ve got. This I’m going to do for fun.
N: Across the way, Cameron and Michael have been watching Bianca and Cameron notices Joey’s admiration.
C: CAMERON
D: Who’s that guy?
C: MICHAEL
D: It’s Joey Donner. He’s a jerkoff. And a model.
C: CAMERON
D: He’s a model?
C: MICHAEL
D: A model. Mostly regional stuff. But he’s rumored to have a tube sock ad coming out.
C: CAMERON
D: Really?
C: MICHAEL
D: Really.
N: They have a laugh at Joey’s expense. Cameron turns back to watching Bianca.
C: CAMERON
D: Man, look at her.
C: MICHAEL
D: Is she always so...vapid?
E: not impressed
C: CAMERON
D: How can you say that? She’s totally...
C: MICHAEL
D: Conceited?
C: CAMERON
D: What are you talking about? There’s more to her than you think. I mean, look... look at the way she smiles. And look at her eyes, man. She’s totally pure. I mean, you’re missing what’s there.
C: MICHAEL
D: No, Cameron. No. What’s there is a snotty little Princess wearing a strategically planned sun dress to make guys like us realize we can never touch her, and guys like, uh...
E: unconvinced
N: He looks around and notices Joey making his way toward the girls.
C: MICHAEL
D: ...Joey, realize they want to. She, my friend, is what we’ll spend the rest of our lives not having. Put her in the Spank Bank. Move on.
E: continuing
C: CAMERON
D: No.
C: MICHAEL
D: Move on.
C: CAMERON
D: No! You’re wrong about her. I mean, you know, uh, not about the spanking part. But the rest. You’re wrong.
C: MICHAEL
D: Alright. I’m wrong? You wanna take a shot? Be my guest. She’s actually looking for a French tutor.
C: CAMERON
D: Are you serious? That’s perfect!
C: MICHAEL
D: Do you speak French?
C: CAMERON
D: Well no. But I will.
S: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Kat and MANDELLA, her best friend--beautiful and attired in quasi-Renaissance clothes--walk toward Kat's car. Joey pulls up beside them in his red sports car.
C: JOEY
D: Hey. Your little Rambo look is out, Kat. Didn’t you read last month’s Cosmo?
E: referring to Kat‘s camouflage top
C: KAT
D: Run along.
E: barely notices him
N: She and Mandella continue walking. Further along, Bianca and Chastity are walking, embroiled in meaningful conversation.
C: CHASTITY
D: I know you can be overwhelmed. You can be underwhelmed. But can you ever just be whelmed?
C: BIANCA
D: I think you can in Europe.
N: Joey pulls up alongside them.
C: JOEY
D: Hi ladies. Would you sweet young things like a ride?
N: They look at each other and immediately hop in, climbing over his upholstery.
C: JOEY
D: Careful on the leather.
N: Across the lot, Kat and Mandella watch this display from inside Kat’s clunker.
C: MANDELLA
D: That’s a charming new development.
E: sarcastic
C: KAT
D: It’s disgusting.
N: Meanwhile, Michael has mounted an old motorcycle equipped with a plastic dork basket on the handles. He jets a bit out of control and kills the engine in front of Kat’s car. Pissed off, she shouts out the window.
C: KAT
D: Remove head from sphincter, then drive!
N: Michael regains control and pulls out of the way to where Cameron has been watching.
C: CAMERON
D: You all right?
C: MICHAEL
D: Yeah, yeah. Just a minor encounter with the shrew. Your girlfriend’s sister.
C: CAMERON
D: What? That's Bianca's sister?
C: MICHAEL
D: Mmm hmm. The mewling, rampalian wretch herself. Stay cool, bro.
N: He jets off once again, risks another near collision, and ends up flying right off the road and sliding halfway down a grassy hill. Recovering his composure, he realizes half the school is watching from the top of the hill. He raises his hands in the air and gives a victory yell, drawing cheers from the crowd.
S: INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
N: WALTER STRATFORD, Kat and Bianca’s overly-protective father--an obstetrician--enters through the front door rifling through the mail.
C: WALTER
D: Hello Katarina. Make anyone cry today?
E: to Kat
C: KAT
D: Sadly, no. But it's only four-thirty.
N: Walter smiles proudly as Bianca walks in and kisses him on the cheek.
C: BIANCA
D: Hi Daddy.
C: WALTER
D: Hello, precious.
C: KAT
D: And where've you been?
C: BIANCA
D: Nowhere.
E: gives Kat a sour look
N: Walter, who hasn’t raised his eyes from the mail, is inspecting a letter.
C: WALTER
D: What's this? It says Sarah Lawrence?
N: Kat snatches it away from him and runs across the room in a flurry of excitement, tearing it open and reading the contents silently.
C: KAT
D: I got in! I got in!
C: WALTER
D: Uh, honey that’s great. But isn’t Sarah Lawrence on the other side of the country?
C: KAT
D: Thus the basis of its appeal.
C: WALTER
D: Yeah. I thought we decided you were gonna stay here and go to U Dub like me. Be a husky.
N: He makes some inspiring growling noises.
C: KAT
D: No, you decided.
C: WALTER
D: Oh okay. So you just pick up and leave, is that it?
C: BIANCA
D: Let’s hope so.
E: brimming at the idea
N: Kat gives Bianca a spiteful look then smiles sweetly.
C: KAT
D: Ask Bianca who drove her home.
C: WALTER
D: Kat, don’t change the...drove? Who drove you home?
E: to Bianca
N: Bianca glares at Kat then turns to Walter
C: BIANCA
D: Now don't get upset, daddy, but there's this boy...
C: KAT
D: Who’s a flaming imbecile.
C: WALTER
D: Please...
C: BIANCA
D: and I think he might ask me...
E: continuing
C: WALTER
D: Please. I think I know what he’s going to ask you. And I think I know the answer: No. It’s always no. What are the house rules? #1: no dating till you graduate. #2: no dating till you graduate. That’s it.
C: BIANCA
D: Daddy, that’s so unfair.
C: WALTER
D: Alright. You wanna know what’s unfair? This is for you too. This morning I delivered a set of twins to a 15 year old girl. Do you know what she said to me?
E: to Kat continues
C: BIANCA
D: I’m a crack-whore who should have made my sleazy boyfriend wear a condom?
N: Walter pauses and thinks for a moment.
C: WALTER
D: Close. But no. She said: I should have listened to my father.
C: BIANCA
D: She did not.
C: WALTER
D: Well, that’s what she would’ve said if she wasn’t so doped up.
C: BIANCA
D: Can we focus on me for a second please? I am the only girl in school who’s not dating.
C: WALTER
D: Oh no you’re not. Your sister doesn’t date.
C: KAT
D: And I don’t intend to.
C: WALTER
D: And why is that again?
N: Walter is pleased and points to Bianca, expecting Kat to justify him.
C: KAT
D: Have you seen the unwashed miscreants that go to that school?
C: BIANCA
D: Where did you come from? Planet Loser?
C: KAT
D: As opposed to planet “look at me! look at me!”?
C: WALTER
D: Okay, here’s how we solve this one. Old rule out. New rule: Bianca can date...
N: Bianca lights up and Kat looks upset.
C: WALTER
D: ...when she does.
E: continuing points at Kat
C: BIANCA
D: But she's a mutant! What if she never dates?
C: WALTER
D: Then you‘ll never date. Oh, I like that. And I'll get to sleep at night. The deep slumber of a father who’s daughters aren’t out being impregnated.
E: very pleased with his new rule
N: His beeper goes off and he heads for the door. Kat heads for the stairs.
C: WALTER
D: We’ll talk about Sarah Lawrence later.
E: to Kat
C: KAT
D: Fine.
C: BIANCA
D: Wait! Daddy!
C: WALTER
D: I gotta go.
N: He leaves.
C: BIANCA
D: Can’t you find [a sad enough] retard to take you to the movies so I can have just one date?
C: KAT
D: I’m sorry. Looks like you’ll just have to miss out on the witty repartee of Joey “eat me” Donner.
C: BIANCA
D: You suck.
C: KAT
D: You suck.
E: imitating Bianca
S: INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
N: Cameron sits at a table prepping for the French lesson he has scheduled with Bianca. Bianca arrives and plops down across from him.
C: BIANCA
D: Can we make this quick? Roxanne, Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad. Again.
C: CAMERON
D: Oh, yeah, um, okay. I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's alright with you.
C: BIANCA
D: Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please.
C: CAMERON
D: Well, there is an alternative. French food. We could eat some together. Saturday night?
C: BIANCA
D: You're asking me out? That's so cute. What's your name again?
C: CAMERON
D: Cameron. Listen. I know that your dad doesn’t let you date. But I thought that if it was for French class it...
C: BIANCA
D: Oh, wait a minute. Curtis...
C: CAMERON
D: Cameron.
C: BIANCA
D: My dad just came up with a new rule. I can date when my sister does.
C: CAMERON
D: You’re kidding! Well let me ask you, do you like sailing? ‘Cause I read about this place that rents out boats...
C: BIANCA
D: A beaucoup problemo, Calvin. In case you haven’t heard, my sister’s a particularly hideous breed of loser.
C: CAMERON
D: Yeah yeah. I noticed she’s a little anti-social. Why is that?
C: BIANCA
D: Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular, and then it was like...she got sick of it. Or something. There is a [bet] as to why, but I’m pretty sure she’s just incapable of human interaction. Plus, she’s a bitch.
C: CAMERON
D: Well yeah, but I’m sure, you know, that there’s lots of guys who wouldn’t mind going out with a...difficult woman. I mean, you know, people jump out of airplanes, ski off cliffs. It would be like extreme dating.
C: BIANCA
D: You think you could find someone that extreme?
C: CAMERON
D: Yeah sure, why not?
N: She reaches out and touches his arm
C: BIANCA
D: Would you do that, for me?
C: CAMERON
D: Oh yes! I mean, you know, I could look into it.
S: EXT. A STAIRWELL ON CAMPUS - DAY
N: Michael leads Cameron down a set of concrete steps to a secret gathering of dating candidates for Kat.
C: MICHAEL
D: Now, I have gathered a group of guys. Couldn’t be more perfect. Padua’s finest.
N: They enter a dank room, wherein waits a very motly crew of the most unlikely specimens one would expect. Cameron shoots Michael an unsatsfied grimace.
C: CAMERON
D: Hi. How ya doin’? Would any of you be interested in dating Katarina Stratford?
N: What follows is a truncated interview process, where each candidate in turn sits in the interview chair and gives his response. CANDIDATE 1 (laughs histerically) CANDIDATE 2 (stares blankly) CANDIDATE 3 Ho, I’ve never been that ripped. CANDIDATE 4 Maybe if we were the last 2 people alive, and there were no sheep... Are there sheep?
S: INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY
N: Several dissection charts of frog anatomy hang on the walls. The class is busy dissecting frogs. Michael and Cameron, naturally, are lab partners. Patrick and his punk rock friend, SCURVY, are hacking away at their own specimen behind them.
C: MICHAEL
D: Did I, or did I not, tell you it was pointless? No one will go out with her.
N: Patrick pulls out a butterfly knife and impales his frog violently with it. Cameron has noticed the display.
C: CAMERON
D: Hey, what about him?
C: MICHAEL
D: Him? No no. Don’t look at him, okay? He's a criminal. I heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just did a year in San Quentin.
C: CAMERON
D: Yeah, well, then at least he’s horny.
C: MICHAEL
D: I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market for a new set of speakers.
N: Patrick has taken out a cigarette, but just as he lights it on the Bunsen burner, Scurvy seizes it and snuffs it out. Frustrated, Patrick plays with the Bunsen burner instead.
C: CAMERON
D: He’s our guy.
N: Patrick notices them watching him and they quickly turn away.
S: INT. WOODSHOP - DAY
N: Boys and a few stray girls nail their pieces of wood. Cameron and Michael enter, and Cameron approaches Patrick optimistically.
C: CAMERON
D: Hi. How ya doin’? Listen, I...
N: In response, Patrick brandishes a loud power tool and drills a hole in the middle of Cameron’s beloved French book.
C: CAMERON
D: Okay... later then.
E: continuing
S: INT. A HALLWAY - DAY
N: Michael is staring through the new window in Cameron’s French book.
C: MICHAEL
D: How do we get him to date Kat?
C: CAMERON
D: I don’t know. I mean, uh, we could pay him. But we don’t have any money.
C: MICHAEL
D: Yeah, well, what we need is a backer.
C: CAMERON
D: What’s that?
C: MICHAEL
D: Someone with money who’s stupid.
N: They both look pensive.
S: INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
N: Joey and his pals sit at a table while Joey draws a pair of boobs on a cafeteria tray with a magic marker.
C: JOEY
D: Oh yeah!
N: Michael walks up and sits at the table, casual as can be.
C: MICHAEL
D: Is that a peach Fruit Roll-Up? ‘Cause you don’t see many...
N: Joey’s friend grabs his wrist as he reaches for the Roll-Up.
C: MICHAEL
D: ...oh, okay. Yeah, Alright.
E: continues
N: His wrist is released as he withdraws his hand.
C: JOEY
D: Are you lost?
C: MICHAEL
D: No, actually, I just came by to chat.
C: JOEY
D: We don't chat.
C: MICHAEL
D: Well, actually, I thought that I'd run an idea by you. Just to see if you're interested.
C: JOEY
D: I’m not.
C: MICHAEL
D: Well, hear me out. Now...
N: Joey grabs Michael by the side of the head and proceeds to draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker. Michael suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted.
C: MICHAEL
D: ...you want Bianca, right? But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her, right?
E: continues
C: JOEY
D: Does this conversation have a purpose?
C: MICHAEL
D: What I think you need to do is, you need to hire a guy who'll go out with her. Someone who doesn’t scare so easy.
N: Michael points to Patrick, who sits with Scurvy. Patrick spits a stone from a piece of fruit at his tray. JOEY That guy? I heard he ate a live duck once.
C: MICHAEL
D: Everything but the beak and the feet. Clearly he’s a solid investment.
N: Joey turns to look at Michael. JOEY What's in it for you?
C: MICHAEL
D: Hey. I’m walkin’ down the hall and say hello to you. You say hello to me.
C: JOEY
D: Yeah yeah. I get it. You’re cool by association. I’ll think about it.
N: Michael looks pleased and bobs his head as if grooving to music.
C: JOEY
D: We’re done now.
E: continuing
C: MICHAEL
D: Yeah.
N: He gets up and walks to the back of the room where Cameron waits anxiously.
C: CAMERON
D: What are you doing getting him involved?
E: upset
C: MICHAEL
D: Relax now, relax. We let him pretend he’s calling the shots. While he’s setting things up, you have time with Bianca.
C: CAMERON
D: That is a good idea.
N: Cameron leaves.
S: EXT. A HILL OVERLOOKING THE STADIUM - DAY
N: Bogie Levenstein has gathered his club of future yuppies for a golf lesson.
C: BOGIE
D: Now remember guys. Grip it, and rip it.
N: He hits the golf ball down into the stadium field, where it is collected by a kid holding a basket of balls. The field is filled with students exercising. The women’s soccer team is practicing. Joey makes his way toward Patrick, who is sitting with Scurvy and smoking.
C: JOEY
D: Hey, how ya doin’?
N: Patrick ignores him completely.
C: JOEY
D: I had some great duck last night...
E: tries to break the ice
C: PATRICK
D: Do I know you?
C: JOEY
D: See that girl?
N: He turns to see Kat playing soccer on the field.
C: PATRICK
D: Yeah.
C: JOEY
D: That’s Kat Stratford. I want you to go out with her.
C: PATRICK
D: Yeah sure, Sparky.
E: sarcastic
N: He and Scurvy laugh at the idea.
C: JOEY
D: Look. I can’t take out her sister until Kat starts dating. You see, their dad’s whacked out. He’s got this rule where the girls...
C: PATRICK
D: That’s a touching story. It really is. Not my problem.
C: JOEY
D: Would you be willing to make it your problem if I provide generous compensation?
C: PATRICK
D: You’re going to pay me to take out some chick?
C: JOEY
D: Mmm hmm.
E: pleased
C: PATRICK
D: How much?
C: JOEY
D: Twenty bucks.
N: Patrick turns to have another look at Kat. She violently body checks another girl and knocks her down.
C: JOEY
D: Fine. 30.
E: continuing
C: PATRICK
D: Well let’s think about this. We go to the movies. That’s, uh, 15 bucks. We get popcorn. That’s, uh, 53. And, uh, she’ll want Raisonettes, right? So, uh, we’re lookin’ at 75 bucks.
C: JOEY
D: This ain’t a negotiation. Take it or leave it, trailer park.
C: PATRICK
D: 50 bucks and we’ve got a deal, Fabio.
N: Joey hands him 50 dollars.
S: EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY
N: Kat and the rest of the team complete their practice session. MR. CHAPIN, the coach, calls the girls in over his megaphone.
C: MR. CHAPIN
D: Great practice, everybody.
N: Patrick snuffs out a cigarette and approaches Kat.
C: PATRICK
D: Hey there, girlie. How ya doin'?
C: KAT
D: Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself?
C: PATRICK
D: Now there's a way to get a guy's attention, huh?
C: KAT
D: My mission in life.
N: She stands there undaunted, hand on hip.
C: KAT
D: But obviously I've struck your fancy. So, you see, it worked. The world makes sense again.
E: continuing
N: She walks away. He follows.
C: PATRICK
D: Pick you up Friday, then
C: KAT
D: Oh, right. Friday. Uh huh.
C: PATRICK
D: The night I take you to places you've never been before.
C: KAT
D: Like where? The 7-Eleven on Broadway? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
C: PATRICK
D: I know a lot more than you think.
C: KAT
D: Doubtful. Very doubtful.
N: She walks away quickly, leaving him standing alone. ACROSS THE FIELD Cameron and Michael watch.
C: CAMERON
D: We are screwed.
C: MICHAEL
D: Hey, no, hey. I don’t want to hear that defeatist attitude. I want to hear you upbeat.
C: CAMERON
D: We are screwed!
C: MICHAEL
D: There you go.
N: As they watch, the coach gets hit with a golf ball and falls to the ground. We cut back to Bogie and his group of MBA nerds.
C: MBA KID
D: Run Bogie!
N: Bogie is motionless, a super-cheese smile glued to his face.
S: INT. STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Kat washes her face at the sink. Bianca enters behind her.
C: BIANCA
D: Have you ever considered a new look? I mean, seriously, you could have some definite potential buried under all this hostility.
C: KAT
D: I’m not hostile. I’m annoyed.
C: BIANCA
D: Why don’t you try being nice? People wouldn’t know what to think.
C: KAT
D: You forget. I don’t care what people think.
C: BIANCA
D: Yes you do.
C: KAT
D: No I don’t. You don’t always have to be who they want you to be, you know.
C: BIANCA
D: I happen to like being adored, thank you.
C: KAT
D: Where’d you get the pearls?
C: BIANCA
D: They’re mom’s
C: KAT
D: And you’ve been what? Hiding them for 3 years?
E: upset
C: BIANCA
D: No. Daddy found them in a drawer last week.
C: KAT
D: So you’re just gonna start wearing them now?
C: BIANCA
D: It’s not like she’s coming back to claim them. And besides, they look good on me.
C: KAT
D: Trust me. They don’t.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY
N: Kat emerges from a store. Patrick is waiting for her, leaning casually against her front fender.
C: PATRICK
D: Nice ride. Vintage fenders.
C: KAT
D: Are you following me?
C: PATRICK
D: I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. I came over to say hi.
C: KAT
D: Hi.
N: She moves to open the door, but he slides over and blocks her way.
C: PATRICK
D: Not a big talker, huh?
C: KAT
D: Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
C: PATRICK
D: You’re not afraid of me, are you?
E: seems genuinely intrigued by her resistance
C: KAT
D: Afraid of you? Why would I be afraid of you?
C: PATRICK
D: Well, most people are.
C: KAT
D: Well, I’m not.
C: PATRICK
D: Well, maybe you’re not afraid of me. But I’m sure you’ve thought about me naked, huh?
N: He gives her a knowing wink.
C: KAT
D: Am I that transparent? I want you, I need you, Oh baby, oh baby.
E: sarcastic
N: She opens the door and forces him out of the way. She starts to pull out and is blocked by Joey's sports car, which pulls up perpendicular to her rear and parks. Joey emerges and heads for the stores.
C: KAT
D: What is it? Asshole day? Hey! Do you mind?
E: to Joey
C: JOEY
D: Not at all.
N: He continues on into the store. Kat stares at him in disbelief... then backs up fast. Her vintage fenders crash into the door of Joey's precious ego-mobile. Patrick watches with a delighted grin as Joey races back to his car.
C: JOEY
D: You bitch!
N: Kat watches with an innocent look of surprise.
C: KAT
D: Whoops.
E: sarcastic
S: INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Walter paces as Kat sits calmly on the couch.
C: WALTER
D: Whoops?! My insurance does not cover PMS.
C: KAT
D: Well, then tell them I had a seizure.
C: WALTER
D: Is this about Sarah Lawrence? Are you punishing me because I want you to stay close to home?
C: KAT
D: Aren’t you punishing me because mom left?
C: WALTER
D: You think you could leave her out of this?
C: KAT
D: Fine. Then stop making my decisions for me.
C: WALTER
D: I’m your father. That's my right.
C: KAT
D: So what I want doesn't matter?
C: WALTER
D: You're eighteen. You don't know what you want. And you won't know what you want until you're forty-five. And if you get it, you’ll be too old to use it.
C: KAT
D: I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices. And I want you to stop trying to control my life just because you can’t control yours.
C: WALTER
D: Oh yeah? Well you know what I want...
N: Walter's BEEPER goes off.
C: WALTER
D: We’ll continue this later.
E: continuing
C: KAT
D: Can’t wait.
N: She heads out of the room and is intercepted by Bianca, who’s just off the phone.
C: BIANCA
D: Did you just maim Joey’s car?
E: angry
C: KAT
D: Yeah. Looks like you’re gonna have to take the bus.
C: BIANCA
D: Has the fact that you’re completely psycho managed to escape your attention?
N: Kat walks away.
C: BIANCA
D: Daddy!
S: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
N: Patrick shuts his locker revealing Joey's angry visage, glowering next to him.
C: JOEY
D: When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
C: PATRICK
D: Yeah, I'm on it.
C: JOEY
D: Watching the bitch violate my car doesn't count as a date.
C: JOEY
D: If you don’t get any, I don’t get any. Let’s go get some.
N: Joey starts to walk off
C: PATRICK
D: I just upped my price
C: JOEY
D: What?
E: turning
C: PATRICK
D: A hundred bucks a date. In advance.
C: JOEY
D: Forget it.
C: PATRICK
D: Forget her sister, then.
N: Joey thinks for a frustrated moment, then peels another fifty out of his wallet.
C: JOEY
D: You better hope you're as smooth as you think you are, Verona.
N: Patrick takes the money with a smile.
S: INT. SHOP CLASS - DAY
N: Michael and Cameron enter the class. Scurvy brushes by them.
C: CAMERON
D: Go.
C: MICHAEL
D: No, you go.
C: CAMERON
D: I went before.
N: Cameron makes his way to where Patrick is working at the buffer.
C: CAMERON
D: We know what you’re trying to do, with Kat Stratford.
E: to Patrick
C: PATRICK
D: Is that right? And what do you plan to do about it?
C: CAMERON
D: Help you out.
C: PATRICK
D: Why’s that?
C: MICHAEL
D: The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
C: PATRICK
D: What is it with this chick? She have beer flavored nipples?
C: CAMERON
D: Hey!
C: MICHAEL
D: I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure. Purer than say -- Joey Donner's.
C: PATRICK
D: Look. I'm in on this for the cash. Donner can plow whoever he wants.
C: CAMERON
D: Okay. There will be no plowing!
C: MICHAEL
D: Patrick, uh, Pat. Let me explain something to you here. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl. Cameron. Joey's just a pawn.
C: PATRICK
D: So you two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
C: MICHAEL
D: We’ll do some research. We’ll find out what she likes. We are your guys.
E: grinning
C: CAMERON
D: And he means that in a strictly non- prison-movie type of way.
C: MICHAEL
D: Let’s start here. Now, Friday night. Bogie Levenstein is having a party. It’s the perfect opportunity.
C: PATRICK
D: Opportunity for what?
C: MICHAEL
D: For you to take out Kat.
C: PATRICK
D: I‘ll think about it.
N: He walks away, leaving Michael and Cameron grinning at each other.
C: MICHAEL
D: And for a little payback. This is gonna be some party.
E: continuing
N: Close-Up on a party invitation Michael holds up. It advertises a “wine and cheese” party. Transition. The words “wine and cheese” are replaced by “free beer”. “Don’t call” and “just show up” are printed at the bottom next to Bogie’s address in Seattle.
C: MICHAEL
D: Let’s do this.
N: Slow motion shot of them dumping a pile of fliers down the school stairwell. Students’ hands reach out and grab them as they fall.
S: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
N: Joey stands at his open locker with Bianca.
C: JOEY
D: Okay now, this is important. Which do you like better?
N: He holds up two identical glamour model photos. In one, he's wearing a white shirt. In the other, he's in a black shirt.
C: BIANCA
D: Um, I think I like the white shirt better.
N: Joey nods thoughtfully.
C: JOEY
D: Yeah. It's more...
C: BIANCA
D: Pensive?
C: JOEY
D: Damn. I was going for thoughtful. So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Friday night?
C: BIANCA
D: Yeah. I might.
N: He gives her his best flirtatious smile
C: JOEY
D: Good, 'cause, you know, I'm not gonna bother if you won't be there.
N: The class bell rings.
C: JOEY
D: See you there.
C: BIANCA
D: Okay.
C: JOEY
D: Bye.
N: She walks away. He turns to a mirror hanging in his locker and winks at himself, then unhappily adjusts an out-of-place hair.
S: EXT. UNDER A BRIDGE - DAY
N: Bianca and Cameron are on a nice walk together. No one else is around.
C: CAMERON
D: So have you heard about Bogey Lowenstein's party?
C: BIANCA
D: Yes. And I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't. Not unless my sister goes.
E: pouting
C: CAMERON
D: Yeah I know. I'm workin' on that. But so far she’s not goin’ for my guy.
N: He fishes for information.
C: CAMERON
D: She's not a...
E: continuing
C: BIANCA
D: KD Lang fan? No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in her drawer once, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
C: CAMERON
D: Okay. So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty guys?
C: BIANCA
D: I don’t know. All I've ever heard her say is that she'd die before dating a guy that smokes.
C: CAMERON
D: Okay. All right. What else?
C: BIANCA
D: You’re asking me to investigate the inner workings of my sister’s twisted mind? I don’t think so.
C: CAMERON
D: Well nothing else has worked. I mean, we need to go behind enemy lines here.
S: INT. KAT’S BEDROOM - DAY
N: Bianca rifles through Kat’s drawers while Cameron watches with notable interest.
C: BIANCA
D: Okay, here we go.
N: As she names off pertinent discoveries, she hands them to Cameron.
C: BIANCA
D: Class schedule, reading list, date book, coffee tickets, um, concert tickets. Ah ha! Black panties!
E: continuing
C: CAMERON
D: What does that tell us?
C: BIANCA
D: She wants to have sex some day, that’s what.
C: CAMERON
D: She could just like the color...
E: flustered by this intimate detail
C: BIANCA
D: You don’t buy black lingerie unless you want someone to see it.
C: CAMERON
D: Oh. So, uh, can I see your room?
E: perhaps encouraged by this development
C: BIANCA
D: No. A girl’s room is very personal.
C: CAMERON
D: Oh.
S: EXT. BIKER BAR - NIGHT
N: Michael and Cameron arrive on Michael’s dumpy motorbike and park next to a hard-looking cat on a heavy bike.
C: BIKER
D: Nice bike.
C: MICHAEL
D: Yeah? You think so?
N: The biker roars off without answering.
S: INT. BIKER BAR - NIGHT
N: Michael and Cameron make their way through the surly denizens of the saloon, who watch them in wonder.
C: CAMERON
D: Wow. Is this what a bar looks like?
C: MICHAEL
D: Don’t touch anything. You may get hepatitis.
N: They head toward Patrick, who plays pool by himself. As they pass another table, Michael picks up the eight ball, ruining the game-winning shot a tough guy is making, and tosses it back onto the table without realizing what he’s done.
C: PATRICK
D: So what've you got for me?
C: CAMERON
D: A little insight into a very complicated girl.
C: MICHAEL
D: Just one question before we start: should you be drinking alcohol when you don't have a liver?
E: to Patrick
C: PATRICK
D: What?!
C: MICHAEL
D: Nothing. Nothing.
C: CAMERON
D: First thing: Kat hates smokers
N: Cameron plucks the cigarette out of Patrick’s fingers and drops it on the floor. Patrick isn’t pleased.
C: PATRICK
D: You’re telling me I'm a - "non-smoker"?
E: spits the word out
C: MICHAEL
D: Yeah. But just for now.
C: CAMERON
D: And there’s another problem. Bianca said that Kat likes -- pretty guys.
N: This is met with silence. Then:
C: PATRICK
D: Are you telling me I’m not a pretty guy?
C: MICHAEL
D: He's very pretty! He’s a gorgeous guy.
C: CAMERON
D: I wasn't sure. I didn’t know.
N: Cameron pulls out a list of information.
C: CAMERON
D: Alright. Okay -- Likes: Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, girl music of the indie-rock persuasion". Here’s a list of CDs that she has in her room.
E: continuing
C: PATRICK
D: So I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments, right?
C: MICHAEL
D: Have you ever been to Club Skunk?
C: CAMERON
D: Her favorite band is playing there tomorrow night.
C: PATRICK
D: I can’t be seen at Club Skunk, alright?
C: CAMERON
D: But she’ll be there. She’s got tickets.
C: MICHAEL
D: Just assail your ears for one night.
C: CAMERON
D: She has a pair of black underwear, if that helps.
C: MICHAEL
D: Couldn’t hurt, right?
E: with a wink-wink-nudge-nudge voice
S: INT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT
N: Patrick walks down the hallway toward the stage and is eyed suspiciously by various girls in the hall. He enters, searches the crowd, and finds Kat dancing with Mandella. He sits at the bar.
C: BARTENDER
D: Verona! What are you doing here tonight?
N: Kat stops dancing and shouts at her friends.
C: KAT
D: I need agua!
N: She heads for the bar.
C: KAT
D: Two waters.
E: to the bartender
N: She spots Patrick ignoring her and looks disgusted.
C: KAT
D: If you’re planning on asking me out again, you might as well just get it over with.
E: to Patrick
C: PATRICK
D: Would you mind? You’re kind of ruining this for me.
E: pretending to be absorbed by the music
C: KAT
D: You’re not surrounded by your usual cloud of smoke.
C: PATRICK
D: I know. I quit. Apparently they’re bad for you.
C: KAT
D: You did?
E: too surprised to be sarcastic
C: PATRICK
D: You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or Raincoats, but they’re not bad.
N: He stands and heads into the crowd. Stunned for a moment, Kat rushes after him.
C: KAT
D: You know who the Raincoats are?
C: PATRICK
D: Why? Don’t you? I was watching you out there before...
N: The song ends and there is a moment of silence in the club as he continues to use his loud-club-volume voice.
C: PATRICK
D: I’ve never seen you look so sexy.
E: continuing
N: The crowd hears him clearly and laughs. He grins with embarrassment.
C: PATRICK
D: Come to Bogie’s party with me.
E: continuing
C: KAT
D: You never give up, do you?
N: She begins to walk away through the crowd.
C: PATRICK
D: Was that a yes?
C: KAT
D: No.
E: shouting over her shoulder
C: PATRICK
D: Well, was that a no?
C: KAT
D: No.
C: PATRICK
D: I’ll see you at 9:30 then.
E: shouting after her
S: INT. STRATFORD LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Bianca and Chastity are dolled-up in party clothes and are attempting to sneak down the stairs and out the door. Walter is reading the paper, facing the opposite direction.
C: WALTER
D: You should have used the window.
N: She pretends everything is normal.
C: BIANCA
D: Hi Daddy.
C: WALTER
D: Hi. Where are we going?
C: BIANCA
D: Well, if you must know, a small study group of friends.
C: WALTER
D: Otherwise known as an orgy?
C: CHASTITY
D: Mr. Stratford, it’s just a party.
C: WALTER
D: And Hell is just a sauna.
N: Kat comes walking down the stairs, oblivious of what’s going on. Walter directs his attention toward Kat.
C: WALTER
D: You know about any party?
N: Kat shrugs and shakes her head.
C: BIANCA
D: People expect me to be there!
C: WALTER
D: If Kat's not going, you're not going.
N: Bianca turns to Kat.
C: BIANCA
D: Why can’t you be normal?
C: KAT
D: Define normal.
C: BIANCA
D: Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal.
C: WALTER
D: What's a Bogey Lowenstein?
C: KAT
D: Bogie’s party is just a lame excuse for all the idiots at our school to drink beer and rub up against each other in hopes of distracting themselves from the pathetic emptiness of their...
N: Chastity and Bianca are familiar with this old rant and chime in to finish her sentence for her.
C: BIANCA/CHASTITY
D: ...meaningless, consumer-driven lives.
N: Kat stops short. Surprised she’s become so predictable.
C: BIANCA
D: Can you, for just one night, forget that you’re completely wretched and be my sister? Please? Please?! C’mon, Kat, please do this for me.
N: She’s very sincere. Kat is swayed.
C: KAT
D: Fine. I’ll make an appearance.
N: Bianca and Chastity look at each other, thrilled, and burst into gleeful screams, hugging Kat from either side.
C: WALTER
D: It's starting.
C: BIANCA
D: It's just a party. Daddy.
N: Walter looks dazed.
C: WALTER
D: I want you to wear the belly.
C: BIANCA
D: Daddy, no!
C: WALTER
D: Not all night. Just around the living room for a minute so you can understand the full weight of your decisions.
N: He rushes to a cupboard and pulls out a padded faux- pregnancy jacket. Bianca limply holds out her arms in defeat. He hangs it on her.
C: BIANCA
D: I am perfectly aware...
C: WALTER
D: Listen to me. Every time you even think about kissing a boy, I want you to picture wearing this under your halter top.
C: BIANCA
D: You are so completely unbalanced.
C: WALTER
D: Uh huh.
C: KAT
D: We’re going now.
C: WALTER
D: Alright, wait a minute. No drinking. No drugs. No kissing. No tattoos. No piercings. No ritual animal slaughter of any kind. Oh god, I’m giving them ideas...
E: to Kat to himself
N: Kat opens the door, and there stands Patrick.
C: KAT
D: What are you doing here?
C: PATRICK
D: Nine-thirty right?
N: Kat's in shock
C: PATRICK
D: I'm early.
E: continuing
C: KAT
D: Whatever. I'm driving.
N: He peeks in behind her.
C: PATRICK
D: Who knocked up your sister?
S: INT. MICHAEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Cameron and Michael are preparing to go to the party. Michael employs a variety of questionable beautification techniques.
C: CAMERON
D: So, then Bianca says that I was right. That she didn't wear the Kenneth Coles with that dress because she thought it was mixing genres. Right? And the fact that I noticed -- and this is a direct quote - "really meant something."
N: Cameron looks At Michael expectantly
C: MICHAEL
D: You told me that part already.
C: CAMERON
D: I've been thinking about it all the time...
C: MICHAEL
D: Stop being so self-involved for one minute. How do I look?
C: CAMERON
D: You look like my great uncle, Milton.
C: MICHAEL
D: You think I should lose the tie?
C: CAMERON
D: Yeah.
E: obviously
C: MICHAEL
D: Maybe you’re right. I’m just so nervous. You know? And I’m also very excited. I’m nervous and I’m excited. It’s all very mixed up. I don’t know...
E: very flustered and nervous
C: CAMERON
D: Okay, alright. Just calm down. Alright.
C: MICHAEL
D: The last party I went to was at Chuck-E-Cheeze. You wanna talk about some fun? That’s a good time.
E: he snorts happily
S: EXT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

S: INT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: BOGEY, the leader of the Future MBA’s, plays the host to some stiff-looking kids arranged on some flowery sofas in a very expensive-looking den. He hands out cigars proudly.

D: Now remember guys. Don’t touch anything.
N: He spots one of his guests fondling a crystal vase and seizes it.
C: BOGEY
D: Oh...what did I tell you?
E: continuing
N: He puts it back where it came from as the doorbell rings. He lights up and heads for the door.
C: BOGEY
D: That must be Nigel with the Brie.
N: Before he gets to the door, the room is stampeded with partiers. Within second the house is filled to capacity. A DJ is suddenly spinning and booze is everywhere.
S: INT. UPSTAIRS BALCONY, BOGIE’S - NIGHT
N: Michael drifts through an archway with a beer in his hand and bee-lines for a busty blonde.
C: MICHAEL
D: You know, I’m thinking about getting a Tercel. Yeah, that’s a Toyota.
E: to girl
N: She winces and she and her friend start to walk away.
C: MICHAEL
D: It has dual-side airbags and a spacious back seat.
E: shouting after her
N: Across the way, Kat and Patrick come up the stairs to the balcony. Patrick encounters a very drunk and happy girl.
C: DRUNK GIRL
D: Kiss me!
E: to Patrick
N: She embraces him and he turns her around and nudges her into the arms of a lonely guy on a chair.
C: PATRICK
D: Kiss him.
N: She immediately falls upon the lucky guy’s lips. He manages to tear himself away for a moment as Patrick passes.
C: LUCKY GUY
D: Hey, thanks man!
E: to Patrick
N: In doing so, he forgets about the girl and drops her on the ground. Meanwhile, Kat has made her way into the next room, where she is met by Joey.
C: JOEY
D: Sweet! Lookin' fresh tonight, Pussy-Kat.
N: Kat gives him a dark look and then stops and points at his forehead.
C: KAT
D: Wait -- was that?-- Did your hairline just recede?
N: He’s flustered for a moment. When he recovers she's already walking away.
C: JOEY
D: Hey, where ya goin?
C: KAT
D: Away.
C: JOEY
D: Your sister here?
C: KAT
D: Stay away from my sister.
C: JOEY

E: smirking
N: A ruckus sounds from the next room and a jock jumps in next to them.
C: JOCK
D: Fight!
C: JOEY
D: Ooo! Fight!
N: He and the Jock run off to watch. Two guys are slugging it out in the den. Bogie watches in horror.
C: BOGIE
D: You guys, please! Take it outside!
N: They wrestle and crash through the bay window onto the grass outside.
C: BOGIE
D: Thank you.
N: Kat pushes through the gathered crowd to get away and encounters Joey with Bianca on his arm.
C: JOEY
D: Hey Kat. Look who found me.
N: Joey and Bianca walk away. She ignores Kat.
C: KAT
D: Bianca, wait!

C: JOEY
D: You see what I did there?
C: BIANCA
D: Um... uh huh.
C: JOEY
D: That was underwear. I’ll show you the bathing suit one next.
N: It’s exactly the same.
C: JOEY
D: You see the difference?
E: continuing

E: to other person
N: Bianca uses the opportunity to slip away.
S: INT. BOGEY'S DEN - NIGHT
N: A cowboy sits with another kid chewing tobacco. He unloads a mouthful of it into a nice crystal vase. Bogie takes the vase from them and moans woefully. Bianca passes, searching the crowd, and spots Joey through an archway striking poses for a crowd. She turns away and faces Cameron, who is obviously not happy with the evening’s turn of events. Bianca decided to avoid the inevitable conflict and pulls Chastity in the opposite direction.

C: KAT
D: No! This one’s mine.
N: She rushes off. Joey enters, grabbing Patrick by the shoulder, distracting him from following Kat.
C: JOEY
D: My man! How did you get her to do it?
C: PATRICK
D: Do what?
C: JOEY
D: Act like a human.
N: They both notice Kat has climbed up on a table in the next room and is dancing. Joey is very pleased and rushes to watch.
C: JOEY
D: Yeah! Alright!

D: Yeah.
C: PATRICK
D: Yeah. And is she worth all this trouble?
E: impatient
C: CAMERON
D: Well, I thought she was. But, you know, I...
C: PATRICK
D: Well she is or she isn’t. See, first of all, Joey is not half the man you are. Secondly, don’t let anyone ever make you feel like you don’t deserve what you want. Go for it!
N: Kat begins to fall off the bench and Patrick catches her again. He stands her up and they walk away.

C: PATRICK
D: Sure, I do.
E: he grins
C: KAT
D: Why?
N: They reach a set of two swings hedged by ivy and stop.
C: PATRICK
D: Well then, because then I'd have to start taking out girls who actually like me.
C: KAT
D: Like you could find one.
C: PATRICK
D: See that, there? Who needs affection when I have blind hatred?
C: KAT
D: Let me sit down for a while.
N: She walks over to the swings and plops down, moving her hands to hang onto the ropes. She sits and looks at him for a moment with a smile. Then falls over backward, just in time to be caught--again.
C: PATRICK
D: Jesus.
N: Patrick sits on the other swing.
C: PATRICK
D: So why'd you let him get to you?
E: continuing
C: KAT
D: Who?
C: PATRICK
D: Joey.
C: KAT
D: I hate him.
C: PATRICK
D: Well, you’ve chosen the perfect revenge: mainlining tequila.
N: They both laugh.
C: KAT
D: Well, you know what they say...
N: He stops the swing
C: PATRICK
D: No. What do they say?
N: Kat is asleep, her head resting against the swing's rope. He’s concerned about her falling asleep with a possible concussion.

N: BIANCA thinks for a few seconds.
C: BIANCA
D: Yes.
E: meekly
C: CAMERON
D: You know, just because you're beautiful, doesn't mean you can treat people like they don't matter. I mean, I really like you. Okay? I defended you when people called you conceited. I helped you when you asked me to. I learned French for you! And then you just blow me off...
N: She looks at him for a moment, then grabs his face and gives him a kiss on the lips. He is stunned. She smiles, then gets out of the car without another word. Cameron looks as though he’s just been told he’s inherited a billion dollars as she turns, smiles, and walks away.

C: MR. MORGAN
D: “In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes. For they and thee a thousand errors note. But ‘tis my heart loves what they despise, who in despite of view is pleas’d to dote.” Now, I know Shakespeare’s a dead white guy. But he knows his shit, so we can overlook that. I want you all to write your own version of this Sonnet.

C: MR. CHAPIN
D: Okay. But how do we get ‘em to look left?
C: KAT
D: Um, like this.
E: in desperation

C: KAT
D: For?
C: PATRICK
D: Acting the way we do.
C: KAT
D: I don't like to do what people expect. Why should I live up to other people’s expectations instead of my own?
C: PATRICK
D: So you disappoint them from the start and then you're covered, right?
C: KAT
D: Something like that
C: PATRICK
D: Then you screwed up
C: KAT
D: How?
C: PATRICK
D: You never disappointed me.
C: PATRICK
D: Are you up for it?
E: after a romantic pause
C: KAT
D: Up for what?
N: He motions to the SIGN for a paint-ball game.
S: EXT. PAINTBALL PARK - DAY
N: They chase each other around and get covered in paint, having a good time of it. Eventually, they end up falling down and literally rolling in the hay, caught in an embrace and a short bit of lip action before the game continues.
S: EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
N: Patrick pulls up outside Kat's house and they get out. Paint still streaks their hair.
C: PATRICK
D: No. None of that stuff is true.
C: KAT
D: State trooper?
C: PATRICK
D: Fallacy. Uh, dead guy in the parking lot?
C: KAT
D: Rumor. The duck?
C: PATRICK
D: Hearsay. Bobby Ridgeway’s balls?
C: KAT
D: Fact. But he deserved it. He tried to grope me in the lunch line.
C: PATRICK
D: Fair enough.
C: KAT
D: The accident?
C: PATRICK
D: It’s real. I lived in Australia until I was 10.
C: KAT
D: With the Pygmies?
C: PATRICK
D: Close. With my mom.
C: KAT
D: Where were you last year? I know the porn career's a lie.
C: PATRICK
D: Do you?
N: They pause for a moment, then laugh.
C: KAT
D: Tell me something true.
C: PATRICK
D: Something true? I hate peas.
C: KAT
D: No. Something real. Something no one else knows.
C: PATRICK
D: Okay. You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me.
E: in-between kissing her neck
C: KAT
D: You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
C: PATRICK
D: I tell myself that every day, actually.
N: He kisses her.
C: PATRICK
D: Go to the prom with me
C: KAT
D: Is that a request or a command?
C: PATRICK
D: C’mon, go with me.
C: KAT
D: No.
C: PATRICK
D: No? Why not?
C: KAT
D: No, I won't go with you
C: PATRICK
D: Why not?
C: KAT
D: Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
C: PATRICK
D: C’mon. People won't expect you to go.
N: Kat turns to him, getting angry.
C: KAT
D: Why are you pushing this? What's in it for you?
N: He plays the role of the guilty, accused husband, answering with an accusatory question.
C: PATRICK
D: Oh, so I need to have a motive to want to be with you?
C: KAT
D: You tell me.
C: PATRICK
D: You need therapy, you know that? Has anyone ever told you that?
C: KAT
D: Answer the question, Patrick
E: suspicious and a little hurt
C: PATRICK
D: Nothing! There is nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company, okay?
E: angry
N: He takes out a cigarette. She throws it away before she storms off and SLAMS the door to the house.
S: INT. STUDY HALL - DAY
N: Cameron and Bianca sit together at a table. She stares at him.
C: CAMERON
D: May I offer you a parsnip?
E: speaking in French
C: BIANCA
D: No, you may not.
E: in French
C: CAMERON
D: Where is my uncle’s pencil?
E: in French
C: BIANCA
D: I don’t know. Perhaps it’s up your ass?
E: in French, impatient
C: CAMERON
D: Wait. Wait a minute. That, that’s not on this page.
E: flustered, in English
C: BIANCA
D: Let me ask you a question, Cameron. When are you going to ask me out?
E: in French, angry
N: She gets up and storms off. Cameron, perplexed at this development, obviously didn’t understand what she said. He flips through his French book for an explanation and evidently finds one.
C: CAMERON
D: Shit.
E: in French
S: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
N: Mandella opens her locker. Hanging inside is a beautiful period-style green dress with a note. Mandella holds the dress up to read the note. The note reads: "0 Fair One. Join me at the prom. I will be waiting. Love, William S." Mandella seems pleased.
S: EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE/PATIO - DAY
N: Walter does crunches on an abdominal machine. He is struggling magnificently.
C: WALTER
D: Seven! Good.
E: grunting He stops and catches his breath
N: He stands up as Bianca enters.
C: BIANCA
D: Daddy?
C: WALTER
D: Hi, honey.
C: BIANCA
D: Um, I want to discuss tomorrow night. As you know, it's the prom...
N: He has been using a stretchy arm workout device, and it suddenly flies away off the balcony.
C: WALTER
D: The prom? Kat has a date?
C: BIANCA
D: Well, no.
C: WALTER
D: Don’t think you’re fooling me for a second. I know who you want to bend the rules for. It's that hot rod Joey.
C: BIANCA
D: What’s a "hot rod"?
C: WALTER
D: It’s a... If your sister’s not going, you're not going. End of story.
C: BIANCA
D: Okay, let’s review. Kat: not interested. Me: dying to go.
C: WALTER
D: You know what happens at proms?
C: BIANCA
D: Yes, daddy. We'll dance, we'll kiss, we'll come home. It’s not quite the crisis situation you imagine.
C: WALTER
D: Kissing, huh? That’s what you think happens? Got news for you. Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day long.
C: BIANCA
D: Can we for 2 seconds ignore the fact that you’re severely unhinged and discuss my need for a night of teenage normalcy?
C: WALTER
D: What’s normal? Those damn Dawson’s River kids sleeping in each other’s beds and whatnot?
C: BIANCA
D: Daddy, that is so not...
C: WALTER
D: Got news for ya. I’m down. I’ve got the 411. And you are not going out and getting jiggy with some boy. I don’t care how dope his ride is.
N: She groans and leaves.
C: WALTER
D: My mama didn’t raise no fool.
E: to himself
N: The stretchy arm device now comes flying back onto the patio and lands in the hot tub.
C: WALTER
D: Thanks, Bill.
E: shouting
S: INT. BIANCA'S ROOM - DAY
N: Bianca lies on her bed watching The Real World Seattle. A knock sounds.
C: BIANCA
D: Come in.
E: annoyed
N: Kat enters.
C: KAT
D: Listen I know...
E: kindly
N: Bianca isn’t listening. Kat turns off the TV.
C: KAT
D: Listen, I know you hate having to sit at home because I'm not Susie High School.
E: continuing
C: BIANCA
D: Like you care.
C: KAT
D: I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, and not someone else's.
C: BIANCA
D: Well, I wish I had that luxury. You know, I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you don’t feel like it.
C: KAT
D: Joey never told you that we went out, did he?
C: BIANCA
D: Yeah, okay.
E: doesn’t believe her
C: KAT
D: In 9th. For a month
C: BIANCA
D: Why?
E: can tell she’s serious and is confused
C: KAT
D: Because he was, like, such a babe.
E: self-mocking
C: BIANCA
D: But you hate Joey
C: KAT
D: Now I do.
C: BIANCA
D: So what happened?
N: Kat indicates with a nod and a raised eyebrow that they went all the way.
C: BIANCA
D: Oh! Please tell me you’re joking.
C: KAT
D: Just once, right after mom left. Everyone was doing it, so... I did it. Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore because I wasn't ready and he got pissed and dumped me.
N: Bianca stares at her, dumbfounded
C: KAT
D: After that I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it. And I haven't since. With the exception of Bogey's party and my stunning digestive pyrotechnics.
E: continuing
C: BIANCA
D: How is it possible that I did not know about this?
E: stunned
C: KAT
D: I warned him that if he told anyone, the cheerleading squad would find out how small his dick is.
C: BIANCA
D: Okay. So why didn't you tell me?
C: KAT
D: I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
C: BIANCA
D: Then why did you help Daddy hold me hostage?
E: angry
N: Bianca stands up slowly
C: BIANCA
D: It’s not like I'm stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
E: continuing
C: KAT
D: I guess I thought I was protecting you.
C: BIANCA
D: By not letting me experience anything for myself?
C: KAT
D: Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
C: BIANCA
D: Well, I guess I'll never know, will I?
N: She rises and holds the door open for Kat, then slams it behind her.
S: INT. KAT'S ROOM - DAY
N: Kat lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. She rolls over and looks out the window. Bianca is looking pitiful in a tire swing.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Walter sits on the couch, transfixed by an ad for an aerosol product that covers baldness.
C: WALTER
D: Interesting...
N: Kat descends the stairs in an elegant blue prom dress and heads for the door.
C: KAT
D: Bye, dad. I'm going to the prom.
C: WALTER
D: Funny, sweetie.
E: without looking up, thinks she‘s joking
N: Kat shuts the door behind her. Bianca walks into the living room. She's wearing a prom dress. Walter sees and immediately crosses to where she stands.
C: WALTER
D: What’s that?
C: BIANCA
D: A prom dress.
C: WALTER
D: I seem to be hearing that word a lot lately.
N: The doorbell rings and Bianca opens it. There stands Cameron in a tuxedo. He takes in Bianca's outfit.
C: BIANCA
D: Hi.
C: CAMERON
D: Wow. I, um... wow.
N: BIANCA Bye, daddy.
C: WALTER
D: Stop. Turn. Explain.
C: BIANCA
D: Okay. Remember how you said I could date if Kat dated? Well, she found this guy who’s actually kind of perfect for her. Which is actually kind of perfect for me, because Cameron asked me to go to the prom, and I really really really wanna go. And since Kat went, I guess I’m allowed to, based on the aforementioned rule, and it’s previous stipulations, of course.
C: CAMERON
D: Nice to meet you.
E: extends his hand to Walter
C: BIANCA
D: Let's go.
E: intercepting his hand
N: They dash away down the walk.
C: WALTER
D: I know every cop in town, bucko! This is not good.
E: shouting after them to himself
S: INT. PROM/DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
N: A band that does not exactly suck by definition plays to a very responsive crowd.
S: INT. PROM/BALCONY - NIGHT
N: Kat ascends the grand staircase and stops. Patrick notices and comes up behind her.
C: PATRICK
D: Wow.
C: KAT
D: You too.
N: He hands her a rose.
C: KAT
D: Where'd you get a tux at the last minute?
C: PATRICK
D: Oh, just something I had. You know, lying around.
C: KAT
D: Oh...
C: PATRICK
D: Where'd you get the dress?
C: KAT
D: Oh, just something I had. You know, lying around.
N: He smiles.
C: KAT
D: Listen. I'm really sorry that I questioned your motives. I was wrong.
N: Patrick sighs.
C: PATRICK
D: You’re forgiven.
C: KAT
D: Okay. Ready for the prom?
C: PATRICK
D: Yes, ma’am.
S: INT. STRATFORD DOORWAY - NIGHT
N: Joey arrives in a tux and knocks on the door. Walter opens it.
C: JOEY
D: Hi, Mr. Stratford. I’m Joey. I'm here to pick up Bianca.
N: Walter gives him an icy glare in silence and then slams the door in his face without saying a word.
S: INT. PROM/DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
N: Patrick and Kat enter. Kat steps forward, looking around and spots Cameron and Bianca dancing cheek to cheek. ACROSS THE ROOM Mandella enters nervously, in the long Elizabethan gown, hair piled on top of her head. She spots Kat and hurries over, distressed.
C: MANDELLA
D: Have you seen him?
C: KAT
D: Who?
C: MANDELLA
D: William - he asked me to meet him here.
C: KAT
D: Oh, Mandella. Tell me you haven't progressed to full-on hallucinations.
N: Patrick looks toward the stage and nods. Mandella turns to look. Michael - in Shakespearean-like attire bows in their direction. Mandella beams. Michael makes his way through the crowd over to her.
C: MICHAEL
D: Milady.
C: MANDELLA
D: Good sir.
N: Michael kisses her hand in courtly manner.
S: INT. PROM/DANCE FLOOR - SHORTLY AFTER
N: Kat and Patrick clap as the band finishes a song. A new song begins and Kat recognizes it. It’s by her favorite band.
C: KAT
D: Oh me god! It’s...
C: PATRICK
D: I called in a favor.
N: Kat stares in honest appreciation as the lead singer of her favorite band appears on stage and makes her way to the crowd to sing directly to Kat. She turns back toward the stage and Patrick kisses Kat. The music plays.
S: INT. PROM/LADIES ROOM - NIGHT
N: Bianca is at the mirror. Chastity emerges from a stall.
C: BIANCA
D: What are you doing here?
E: surprised
N: Chastity is aloof.
C: CHASTITY
D: Oh, I know you didn’t think you were the only sophomore at the prom? Joey just picked me up.
C: BIANCA
D: Well congratulations. He’s all yours.
N: Chastity maintains her snooty tone.
C: CHASTITY
D: Very generous, princess. And just so you know, Joey only liked you for one reason. He even had a bet going with his friends. He was gonna nail you tonight.
N: Bianca, very disturbed, runs away.
S: INT. PROM/DANCE FLOOR - IMMEDIATELY AFTER
N: Patrick and Kat continue to slow dance in good spirits.
C: PATRICK
D: Milwaukee.
C: KAT
D: What?
C: PATRICK
D: That's where I was last year. I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I didn’t sleep with a Spice Girl--I don’t think. You see, my grandpa, he was ill, so I spent most of the year on his couch watching Wheel of Fortune and making Spaghettios. End of story.
C: KAT
D: No way!
E: laughs
N: He's interrupted by Joey pulling him aside.
C: JOEY
D: Hey! What's Bianca doing here with that cheese dick? I didn't pay you to take out Kat so that some little punk could snake me with Bianca.
E: angry
N: Kat has heard everything. Patrick looks at her pleadingly.
C: KAT
D: Nothing in it for you, huh?
N: She leaves. Patrick follows. ACROSS THE ROOM Michael spots the altercation and dances Mandella over to Cameron and Bianca.
C: MICHAEL
D: The shit has hiteth the fan...eth.
E: to Cameron
N: Michael and Cameron leave Mandella and Bianca and head for Joey. ACROSS THE ROOM Michael and Cameron approach Joey quickly.
C: MICHAEL
D: Joey, pal, compadre. Listen...
N: Joey pushes him roughly to the ground. Cameron passes Joey to help Michael.
C: JOEY
D: You messed with the wrong guy, and now you’re gonna pay. You, and that little bitch.
N: Cameron doesn’t like the sound of that. He turns and faces Joey.
C: CAMERON
D: Alright, that’s enough! Okay? You crossed the line.
N: Joey punches Cameron in the face, knocking him to the ground.
C: JOEY
D: Oh come on! Get up, you little punk!
N: He turns around, just in time to catch one in the nose from a very pissed off Bianca.
C: JOEY
D: Shit, Bianca! I’m shooting a nose spray ad tomorrow!
C: BIANCA
D: That's for making my date bleed...
N: She belts him again.
C: BIANCA
D: That's for my sister...
E: continuing
N: And again.
C: BIANCA
D: And that's for me.
E: continuing
N: She pushes him onto the ground with Michael and Cameron. She and Mandella help their dates off the floor.
C: BIANCA
D: Are you okay?
E: to Cameron
C: CAMERON
D: Never been better.
E: smiling big
N: She kisses him and they begin to dance. Everyone slow dances as Joey groans on the floor and holds his crotch.
S: INT. HOTEL STAIRWAY- NIGHT
N: KAT heads for the stairs and Patrick catches up to her as they reach the top.
C: PATRICK
D: Would you give me a chance...
C: KAT
D: You were paid to take me out! By the one person I truly hate. I knew this was a set-up!
C: PATRICK
D: Kat, it wasn't like that, okay?
C: KAT
D: Really? What was it like? A down payment now and then a bonus for sleeping with me?
C: PATRICK
D: No, I didn't care about the money, okay? I cared... I cared about you.
N: She turns to face him with a countenance of both sadness and anger.
C: KAT
D: You are so not who I thought you were.
N: In desperation, he grabs her and kisses her. After a second, she jerks away and flees down the stairs and out of sight. Bianca comes running from behind Patrick, sees what has happened, and stops. She seems guilty now for dragging Kat to the prom and into this mess.
S: EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
N: Kat is sitting on the balcony railing with a sketchbook in hand. Bianca breezes in, bearing a cup of tea, and offers it to Kat.
C: BIANCA
D: You want?
N: Kat takes the tea.
C: KAT
D: Thanks.
C: BIANCA
D: So, you sure you don't want to go sailing with us? It'll be fun.
C: KAT
D: No, I'm fine.
C: BIANCA
D: Look. I don’t know if I ever thanked you for going last night, but it really meant a lot to me.
C: KAT
D: I’m glad.
N: Cameron comes jogging up the steps to the balcony, looking very chipper indeed. He notices the seriousness of the situation.
C: CAMERON
D: Hey.
E: to Bianca, quietly
C: BIANCA
D: Hey.
E: quietly
C: CAMERON
D: You ready?
C: BIANCA
D: Mm hmm.
C: CAMERON
D: See you later.
E: to Kat
C: KAT
D: Bye.
E: waves
N: Bianca and Cameron walk away from Kat.
C: CAMERON
D: Is she okay?
E: to Bianca, quietly
C: BIANCA
D: I hope so.
N: They leave and moments later Walter enters the balcony from the house.
C: WALTER
D: Where’s your sister going?
C: KAT
D: She’s meeting some bikers. Big ones. Full of sperm.
E: sarcastic, as usual
C: WALTER
D: Funny. So tell me about this dance. Was it.. hoppin‘?
E: not amused
N: She smirks at his attempted use of hip, young lingo.
C: KAT
D: Parts of it.
C: WALTER
D: Which parts?
C: KAT
D: The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
C: WALTER
D: Bianca did what?
C: KAT
D: What's the matter? Upset that I rubbed off on her?
C: WALTER
D: No. Impressed.
N: Kat looks up, surprised at her father‘s approval.
C: WALTER
D: You know, fathers don't like to admit it when their daughters are capable of running their own lives. It means we've become spectators. Bianca still lets me play a few innings. You've had me on the bench for years. And when you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
E: continuing
C: KAT
D: When I go?
E: hopeful
C: WALTER
D: Oh, boy. Don't tell me you've changed your mind. I already sent 'em a check.
N: Kat, overjoyed, reaches over and gives him a hug. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY Mr. Morgan stands at a podium and faces the class with an open book in front of him.
C: MR. MORGAN
D: All right. I assume everyone has found time to complete their poem. Except for Mr. Donner...
N: He begins to laugh, very pleased. Joey sulks at his desk behind a pair of sunglasses.
C: MR. MORGAN
D: ...who has an excuse. Shaft, lose the glasses.
E: to Joey
N: Joey reluctantly removes his shades to reveal severe damage. The class snickers.
C: MR. MORGAN
D: Alright. Anyone brave enough to read theirs aloud?
E: continuing
N: No one moves. Then Kat slowly raises her hand.
C: KAT
D: I will.
N: Patrick looks up.
C: MR. MORGAN
D: Lord. Here we go.
E: anticipating the worst
N: Kat stands and walks to face the class. She clears her throat before reading from her notebook.
C: KAT
D: I hate the way you talk to me And the way you cut your hair. I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare. I hate your big dumb combat boots And the way you read my mind. I hate you so much it makes me sick. It even makes me rhyme.
N: She pauses, then continues.
C: KAT
D: I hate it... I hate the way you're always right. I hate it when you lie. I hate it when you make me laugh; Even worse when you make me cry.
E: continuing
N: She begins to cry as she continues to read.
C: KAT
D: I hate it when you're not around And the fact that you didn't call, But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you; Not even close; Not even a little bit; Not even at all.
E: continuing
N: She looks directly at Patrick. He looks back this time, morose, thoughtful. Then she walks out of the room The rest of the class remains in stunned silence.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTER SCHOOL
N: Students are leaving school. Kat walks to her car alone. When she opens the door, she's greeted with the same Fender Stratocaster guitar that Patrick saw her playing in the store before, reclining in the front seat. She picks it up slowly, inspecting every detail, as Patrick leans in behind her.
C: PATRICK
D: Nice, huh?
C: KAT
D: A Fender Strat? Is this for me?
C: PATRICK
D: Yeah. I thought you could use it. You know, when you start your band. Besides, I had some extra cash, you know. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
C: KAT
D: Is that right?
E: smiling
C: PATRICK
D: Yeah, but I screwed up. I, um... I fell for her.
N: He blushes and looks down.
C: KAT
D: Really?
C: PATRICK
D: It's not every day you find a girl who'll flash someone to get you out of detention.
N: Kat is surprised and embarrassed that he found out about the flashing.
C: KAT
D: Oh, god...
N: She laughs. He takes this as a sign to kiss her and he does. She lets him this time, then breaks it off suddenly.
C: KAT
D: You can't just buy me a guitar every time you screw up, you know.
N: He winces.
C: PATRICK
D: Yeah, I know. But then, you know, there’s always drums and bass and maybe even one day a tambourine.
N: He gives her another kiss, which she breaks off again.
C: KAT
D: And don't just think you can...
N: He kisses her to shut her up, not letting her end it this time. As the music plays, we pan out of the parking lot, across to the school building, and up to where the band is playing on the roof. The music plays, the credits roll. THE END
