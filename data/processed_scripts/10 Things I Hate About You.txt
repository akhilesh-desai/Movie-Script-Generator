[SCENE]INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going new kid at school with an optimistic, innocent face, sits facing MISS PERKY, a conservative spinster stereotype turned on its head. She’s in the middle of composing some racy lines from her pulp romance-novel-in-progress on her laptop.[/ACTION]

[DIALOGUE]Yeah. My dad’s a...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MISS PERKY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]That’s enough. I'm sure you won't find Padua any different than your old school. Same little asswipe shit-for-brains everywhere.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Excuse me. Did you just say... Am I in the right office?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MISS PERKY[/CHARACTER]

[DIALOGUE]Oh very clever, kangaroo boy. Says here you exposed yourself in the cafeteria?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]PATRICK[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I was joking with the lunch lady. It was a bratwurst.[/DIALOGUE]

[ACTION]They approach a group of studious-looking teens who are bent over textbooks at a table.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MICHAEL[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]These are your future MBAs- We're all Ivy League accepted. Yuppie greed is back, my friend. Hey guys. How ya doin’?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]One of them looks annoyed and mutters something about “Bogie”. It is, in fact BOGIE LEVENSTEIN himself, leader of the academic geeks. Why does he mutter his own name? Maybe he just likes to speak in the third person...[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MICHAEL[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yesterday I was their god.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What happened?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MICHAEL[/CHARACTER]

[ACTION]Bianca walks with her friend, CHASTITY, a cute and seemingly less loquacious version of herself.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]

[CHARACTER]BIANCA’S FRIEND[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]But I love my Sketchers.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]That’s because you don’t have a Prada backpack.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA’S FRIEND[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Ohhh![/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Romantic? Hemingway?! He was an abusive alcoholic misogynist who squandered half his life hanging around Picasso trying to nail his leftovers.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]JOEY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]As opposed to a bitter self-righteous hag who has no friends?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]A few giggles. Kat fumes from her seat without looking back.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MR. MORGAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Pipe down, Chachie.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I guess in this society being male and an asshole makes you worthy of our time. What about Sylvia Platt or Charlotte Bronte or Simone de Beauvoir?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Patrick suddenly steps into the classroom, late.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]PATRICK[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What’d I miss?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]

[ACTION]She smiles to herself, her social indignation justified.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MR. MORGAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I know how difficult it must be for you to overcome all those years of upper middle class suburban oppression. It must be tough.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]She deflates and becomes bitter again.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MR. MORGAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]But the next time you storm around the PTA crusading for better lunch meat, or whatever it is you white girls complain about, ask them why they can’t buy a book written by a black man![/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Two of the White Rasta kids from earlier take up his cry of inequality.[/ACTION]

[DIALOGUE]That’s right mon![/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MR. MORGAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Don’t even get me started on you two![/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]They grumble apologetically and quickly shut up. Kat is fuming again.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Anything else?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MR. MORGAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yeah. Go to the office. You’re pissing me off.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]JUDITH[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I’ll look it up.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MISS PERKY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Okay.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Kat approaches the office and overhears Miss Perky searching for the right word.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MISS PERKY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]...swollen...turgid...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Tumescent?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MISS PERKY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Perfect! So I hear you were terrorizing Mr. Morgan‘s class. Again.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MISS PERKY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]The way you expressed your opinion to Bobby Ridgeway? By the way, his testicle retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MISS PERKY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]The point is Kat...[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]She suddenly makes the connection between Kat’s name and the picture of a cat on her coffee mug. She finds it amusing and points to the mug.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MISS PERKY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Cat! People perceive you as somewhat ...[/DIALOGUE]

[DIALOGUE]You might want to work on that. Thank you.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]How can you say that? She’s totally...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MICHAEL[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Conceited?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What are you talking about? There’s more to her than you think. I mean, look... look at the way she smiles. And look at her eyes, man. She’s totally pure. I mean, you’re missing what’s there.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MICHAEL[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No, Cameron. No. What’s there is a snotty little Princess wearing a strategically planned sun dress to make guys like us realize we can never touch her, and guys like, uh...[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]He looks around and notices Joey making his way toward the girls.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MICHAEL[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]...Joey, realize they want to. She, my friend, is what we’ll spend the rest of our lives not having. Put her in the Spank Bank. Move on.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MICHAEL[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Move on.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No! You’re wrong about her. I mean, you know, uh, not about the spanking part. But the rest. You’re wrong.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MICHAEL[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Alright. I’m wrong? You wanna take a shot? Be my guest. She’s actually looking for a French tutor.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Are you serious? That’s perfect![/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MICHAEL[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Do you speak French?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Well no. But I will.[/DIALOGUE]

[SCENE]EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY[/SCENE]

[DIALOGUE]Run along.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]She and Mandella continue walking. Further along, Bianca and Chastity are walking, embroiled in meaningful conversation.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]CHASTITY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I know you can be overwhelmed. You can be underwhelmed. But can you ever just be whelmed?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]

[ACTION]Michael regains control and pulls out of the way to where Cameron has been watching.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You all right?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MICHAEL[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yeah, yeah. Just a minor encounter with the shrew. Your girlfriend’s sister.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What? That's Bianca's sister?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MICHAEL[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Mmm hmm. The mewling, rampalian wretch herself. Stay cool, bro.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]He jets off once again, risks another near collision, and ends up flying right off the road and sliding halfway down a grassy hill.

[DIALOGUE]Hello, precious.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]And where've you been?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Nowhere.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Walter, who hasn’t raised his eyes from the mail, is inspecting a letter.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What's this? It says Sarah Lawrence?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Kat snatches it away from him and runs across the room in a flurry of excitement, tearing it open and reading the contents silently.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I got in! I got in![/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Uh, honey that’s great. But isn’t Sarah Lawrence on the other side of the country?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Thus the basis of its appeal.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yeah. I thought we decided you were gonna stay here and go to U Dub like me. Be a husky.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No, you decided.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]and I think he might ask me...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Please. I think I know what he’s going to ask you. And I think I know the answer: No. It’s always no. What are the house rules? #1: no dating till you graduate. #2: no dating till you graduate. That’s it.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Daddy, that’s so unfair.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Alright. You wanna know what’s unfair? This is for you too. This morning I delivered a set of twins to a 15 year old girl. Do you know what she said to me?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I’m a crack-whore who should have made my sleazy boyfriend wear a condom?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Walter pauses and thinks for a moment.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]

[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]She did not.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Well, that’s what she would’ve said if she wasn’t so doped up.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Can we focus on me for a second please? I am the only girl in school who’s not dating.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Oh no you’re not. Your sister doesn’t date.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]And I don’t intend to.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]And why is that again?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Walter is pleased and points to Bianca, expecting Kat to justify him.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Have you seen the unwashed miscreants that go to that school?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Where did you come from? Planet Loser?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]As opposed to planet “look at me! look at me!”?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Okay, here’s how we solve this one. Old rule out. New rule: Bianca can date...[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Bianca lights up and Kat looks upset.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]...when she does.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]But she's a mutant! What if she never dates?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Then you‘ll never date. Oh, I like that. And I'll get to sleep at night. The deep slumber of a father who’s daughters aren’t out being impregnated.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]His beeper goes off and he heads for the door. Kat heads for the stairs.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]We’ll talk about Sarah Lawrence later.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Wait! Daddy![/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I gotta go.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]He leaves.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Can’t you find [a sad enough] retard to take you to the movies so I can have just one date?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I’m sorry. Looks like you’ll just have to miss out on the witty repartee of Joey “eat me” Donner.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You suck.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You suck.[/DIALOGUE]

[DIALOGUE]Can we make this quick? Roxanne, Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad. Again.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Oh, yeah, um, okay. I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's alright with you.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Well, there is an alternative. French food. We could eat some together. Saturday night?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You're asking me out? That's so cute. What's your name again?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Cameron. Listen. I know that your dad doesn’t let you date. But I thought that if it was for French class it...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Oh, wait a minute. Curtis...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Cameron.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]My dad just came up with a new rule. I can date when my sister does.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You’re kidding! Well let me ask you, do you like sailing? ‘Cause I read about this place that rents out boats...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]A beaucoup problemo, Calvin. In case you haven’t heard, my sister’s a particularly hideous breed of loser.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yeah yeah. I noticed she’s a little anti-social. Why is that?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular, and then it was like...she got sick of it. Or something. There is a [bet] as to why, but I’m pretty sure she’s just incapable of human interaction. Plus, she’s a bitch.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Well yeah, but I’m sure, you know, that there’s lots of guys who wouldn’t mind going out with a...difficult woman. I mean, you know, people jump out of airplanes, ski off cliffs. It would be like extreme dating.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yeah, well, then at least he’s horny.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]JOEY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Does this conversation have a purpose?[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]PATRICK[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Not a big talker, huh?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]PATRICK[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You’re not afraid of me, are you?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Afraid of you? Why would I be afraid of you?[/DIALOGUE]

[DIALOGUE]Aren’t you punishing me because mom left?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You think you could leave her out of this?[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Where is my uncle’s pencil?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I don’t know. Perhaps it’s up your ass?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Wait. Wait a minute. That, that’s not on this page.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Let me ask you a question, Cameron. When are you going to ask me out?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]She gets up and storms off. Cameron, perplexed at this development, obviously didn’t understand what she said. He flips through his French book for an explanation and evidently finds one.[/ACTION]

[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]The prom? Kat has a date?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Well, no.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Don’t think you’re fooling me for a second. I know who you want to bend the rules for. It's that hot rod Joey.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What’s a "hot rod"?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]It’s a... If your sister’s not going, you're not going. End of story.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Okay, let’s review. Kat: not interested. Me: dying to go.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You know what happens at proms?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yes, daddy. We'll dance, we'll kiss, we'll come home. It’s not quite the crisis situation you imagine.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Kissing, huh? That’s what you think happens? Got news for you. Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day long.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Can we for 2 seconds ignore the fact that you’re severely unhinged and discuss my need for a night of teenage normalcy?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What’s normal? Those damn Dawson’s River kids sleeping in each other’s beds and whatnot?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Daddy, that is so not...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Got news for ya. I’m down. I’ve got the 411. And you are not going out and getting jiggy with some boy. I don’t care how dope his ride is.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]She groans and leaves.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]My mama didn’t raise no fool.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]The stretchy arm device now comes flying back onto the patio and lands in the hot tub.[/ACTION]

[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Listen I know...[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Bianca isn’t listening. Kat turns off the TV.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Listen, I know you hate having to sit at home because I'm not Susie High School.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Like you care.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, and not someone else's.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Well, I wish I had that luxury. You know, I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you don’t feel like it.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Joey never told you that we went out, did he?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yeah, okay.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]In 9th. For a month[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Why?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Because he was, like, such a babe.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]But you hate Joey[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Now I do.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]So what happened?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Kat indicates with a nod and a raised eyebrow that they went all the way.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Oh! Please tell me you’re joking.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Just once, right after mom left. Everyone was doing it, so... I did it. Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore because I wasn't ready and he got pissed and dumped me.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Bianca stares at her, dumbfounded[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]After that I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it. And I haven't since. With the exception of Bogey's party and my stunning digestive pyrotechnics.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]How is it possible that I did not know about this?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I warned him that if he told anyone, the cheerleading squad would find out how small his dick is.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Okay. So why didn't you tell me?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Then why did you help Daddy hold me hostage?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Bianca stands up slowly[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]It’s not like I'm stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I guess I thought I was protecting you.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]By not letting me experience anything for myself?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Well, I guess I'll never know, will I?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]She rises and holds the door open for Kat, then slams it behind her.[/ACTION]

[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What’s that?[/DIALOGUE]

[ACTION]BIANCA Bye, daddy.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Stop. Turn. Explain.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Okay. Remember how you said I could date if Kat dated? Well, she found this guy who’s actually kind of perfect for her. Which is actually kind of perfect for me, because Cameron asked me to go to the prom, and I really really really wanna go. And since Kat went, I guess I’m allowed to, based on the aforementioned rule, and it’s previous stipulations, of course.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]CAMERON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Nice to meet you.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]BIANCA[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Let's go.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Where'd you get a tux at the last minute?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]PATRICK[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Oh, just something I had. You know, lying around.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Oh...[/DIALOGUE]

[DIALOGUE]Where'd you get the dress?[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]PATRICK[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Milwaukee.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]PATRICK[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]That's where I was last year. I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I didn’t sleep with a Spice Girl--I don’t think. You see, my grandpa, he was ill, so I spent most of the year on his couch watching Wheel of Fortune and making Spaghettios. End of story.[/DIALOGUE]

[ACTION]He's interrupted by Joey pulling him aside.[/ACTION]

[DIALOGUE]Alright, that’s enough! Okay? You crossed the line.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Joey punches Cameron in the face, knocking him to the ground.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]JOEY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Oh come on! Get up, you little punk![/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]PATRICK[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Kat, it wasn't like that, okay?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Really? What was it like? A down payment now and then a bonus for sleeping with me?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]PATRICK[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No, I didn't care about the money, okay? I cared... I cared about you.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]She turns to face him with a countenance of both sadness and anger.[/ACTION]

[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No. Impressed.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Kat looks up, surprised at her father‘s approval.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You know, fathers don't like to admit it when their daughters are capable of running their own lives. It means we've become spectators. Bianca still lets me play a few innings. You've had me on the bench for years. And when you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]When I go?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WALTER[/CHARACTER]

[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I will.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Patrick looks up.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MR. MORGAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Lord. Here we go.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Kat stands and walks to face the class. She clears her throat before reading from her notebook.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I hate the way you talk to me And the way you cut your hair. I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare. I hate your big dumb combat boots And the way you read my mind. I hate you so much it makes me sick. It even makes me rhyme.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]She pauses, then continues.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I hate it... I hate the way you're always right. I hate it when you lie. I hate it when you make me laugh; Even worse when you make me cry.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I hate it when you're not around And the fact that you didn't call, But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you; Not even close; Not even a little bit; Not even at all.[/DIALOGUE]

She picks it up slowly, inspecting every detail, as Patrick leans in behind her.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]PATRICK[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Nice, huh?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]A Fender Strat? Is this for me?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]PATRICK[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yeah. I thought you could use it. You know, when you start your band. Besides, I had some extra cash, you know. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Is that right?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]PATRICK[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yeah, but I screwed up. I, um... I fell for her.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]He blushes and looks down.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Really?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]PATRICK[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]It's not every day you find a girl who'll flash someone to get you out of detention.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Kat is surprised and embarrassed that he found out about the flashing.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Oh, god...[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]She laughs. He takes this as a sign to kiss her and he does. She lets him this time, then breaks it off suddenly.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You can't just buy me a guitar every time you screw up, you know.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]He winces.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]PATRICK[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yeah, I know. But then, you know, there’s always drums and bass and maybe even one day a tambourine.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]He gives her another kiss, which she breaks off again.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]KAT[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]And don't just think you can...[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]He kisses her to shut her up, not letting her end it this time. As the music plays, we pan out of the parking lot, across to the school building, and up to where the band is playing on the roof. The music plays, the credits roll. THE END[/ACTION]
