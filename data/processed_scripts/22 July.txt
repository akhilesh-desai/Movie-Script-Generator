BREIVIKS MOTHER No. (beat) I told the police that I saw he had guns in his bedroom. But he told me he needed them for hunting. And I believed him. LIPPESTAD Would you consider testifying in Anders’ defense? BREIVIKS MOTHER What would I say? LIPPESTAD Just that there were problems, in his childhood. It would help him. BREIVIK’S MOTHER But then everyone will know who I am. LIPPESTAD Anders is entitled to a defense, just like everyone else. BREIVIKS MOTHER (crying) I can’t do it. LIPPESTAD (packing up) Thank you for your time. LIPPESTAD goes to the door. BREIVIK’S MOTHER He’s kind of right though, isn’t he. The way the country’s going. It’s not like it used to be.

TV REPORTER According to his critics, Prime Minister Stoltenberg has been accused of wasting a once in a lifetime economic boom. His Labour Party is still predicting to win the most votes, but polls suggest overall power will go to a coalition of centre-right parties. In many ways it’s a peculiar shift. One change Norwegians may get as a result of this election is the Progress Party. It’s a populist anti-immigration movement that mass- killed Anders Breivik used to be a member of.

I would hang him from a tree! ANGRY PARENT 3 He shouldn’t be allowed to turn this trial into propaganda! FAMILY LAWYER I agree, I agree, and I’m going to be there to make sure that doesn’t happen. We are closing the trial with victims’ testimonies. That’s why it’s important that those who survived speak about their experience to stand up against his defense. I think it will be a very very strong statement. ANGRY PARENT 3 He gets to speak? My daughter’s too scared to leave her bedroom! ANGRY MOTHER What about my daughter’s voice?!

GJØRV I want to begin to explore to what extent Government was aware of the threat posed by Anders Behring Breivik prior to his attacks on 22nd of July. PRIME MINISTER That was obviously a question that concerned me greatly. The Security Services told me they had no warnings. That he operated completely out of sight. GJORV Prime Minister, our investigation suggests something different. We have discovered that Mr. Breivik’s purchase of chemicals that he used in the construction of the bomb came to the attention of the customs services in January 2011. But this was not acted on. PRIME MINISTER That was not what I was told, Madam Chair. GJORV Can we turn now to the issue of physical security around the Government Quarters? You can turn to tab 3. (beat) It appears from the papers there were proposals discussed inside government to improve physical security around the Prime Minister’s Office. The PM reads.

(using his right hand) Five times. When I was lying on the beach. I was... all alone. In a kind of pain I couldn’t imagine. BREIVIK looks up momentarily. Catches VILJAR’s eye. FAMILY LAWYER But you’re here now. VILJAR steels himself, keeping his emotion at bay. VILJAR But everything is different. I’ve had to relearn how to use my body.

So they will not be forgotten. VILJAR looks right at BREIVIK. Tears, but an unwavering stare. VILJAR (CONT’D) When he shot them and left me alone on the beach, I didn’t know if I was living or dying. And I’ve been stuck there ever since. On BREIVIK, looking right back at him. VILJAR (CONT’D) But now I realise that I got a choice. Because I still have family. And friends. And memories. And dreams. Hope. And love. (beat) (beat) And he doesn’t. He’s completely alone. And he’s going to rot in prison, whereas I... I survived and I choose to live. And at that moment, BREIVIK looks away.
