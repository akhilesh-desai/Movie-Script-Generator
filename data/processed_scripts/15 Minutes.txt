[SCENE]INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT[/SCENE]

[CHARACTER]LEON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine position - that they were doin' each other but were so whacked out of their heads they set the pipe on the mattress, lit it up, and they got fried. What do you think, Eddie?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Jordy enters - with Korfin who's carrying a paint can.[/ACTION]

[CHARACTER]LEON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No. Go ahead.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Thanks. Appreciate it.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Jordy throws a look at Korfin. Homicide detectives have no respect for fire marshals' investigative skills. Eddie rummages through the apartment - moving into the kitchen and living room... Leon watches as Korfin sticks a pencil in a charred beam, measuring how deep in it goes.[/ACTION]

[CHARACTER]KORFIN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]But you knew that, right?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Leon looks at Jordy, then lowers the handkerchief. Jordy turns back to the corpses on the bed. Eddie - in the other room - has found Tamina's brushed gold bracelet on the floor.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]LEON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]That's what it looks like to me.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other? You got to hand it to them.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]CAMELLO[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No problem. Excuse me, gentlemen. You might wanna back up a little more. Don't wanna get your pants wet.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Leon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt TV set. Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon. As Camello hacks at the floor with an ax, Jordy continues to examine the bodies and Korfin explains:[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]KORFIN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]They have not soot in their mouths, which means they weren't breathin' before the fire and that usually means they were deceased - and this piece of cloth that my partner found means they were wrapped up in something, probably doused with a flammable liquid and positioned like this on the bed. To the untrained eye, it looks like an accident.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Jordy kicks around the draining floor, reaches down for something.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]LEON[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What's he looking for?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]A timer.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]

He only catches a glimpse of her. He starts toward her -- knifes through the crowd - but Daphne is gone.[/ACTION]

[DIALOGUE]-- From Czechoslovakia? And how long have they been livin' in your building? Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'. Milos and Tamina Karlova. They were quiet and kept to themselves. Landlord don't know who your girl is.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]How long they been livin' here?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]KORFIN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You hear that question, Garcia?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]GARCIA[/CHARACTER]

[CHARACTER]KORFIN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Why don't we get some sleep and we'll go see him in the morning.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You go home. I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]

[SCENE]INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - DAWN[/SCENE]
[ACTION]CAMERA DESCENDS FROM THE SKY picking up Jordy as he enters what is left of Milos and Tamina's apartment. The roof has been burned off. He moves into the next room, trying to see through the darkness - looking through the muck and char.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Okay to smoke?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Jordy turns, surprised. Eddie sits on a singed chair. He pours from a half-pint bottle of vodka into his 'won ton soup' container, smoking a cigar. On the arm of the armchair is a brown legal folder and stacks of photographs of the crime scene and the burned bodies.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]It's your crime scene now. You can do what you want.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Watch the news?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Nah, I musta missed it.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Nah, why should you?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I don't even watch TV.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Good. Good. Commendable.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Eddie knocks his 'won ton soup' back.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Did you get a report from the M.E.?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Sure. But I would like to ask you something. You got a problem with me?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too. What about the report?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You were right, they were both dead before the fire. The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine. That's usually an indicator of something personal.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Jordy pulls out a sketch of Daphne. Hands it to Eddie.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Pretty.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Hmmmm.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]

[ACTION]Jordy tries to take the sketch back. Eddie holds on.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What would you call her?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this. I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something. Maybe she was visiting somebody here. Who knows?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Eddie walks up to the burnt mattress - where the bodies were.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Obviously they weren't having sex. As you pointed out. So why go through all the trouble of putting 'em like that?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Eddie passes a crime scene photo of the bodies to Jordy.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message. Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe. It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Eastern Europe. Like what? Romania? Hungary?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Or Czechoslovakia. The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years. These are very intense people and they take things personally.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Eddie's cellular rings - he grabs it.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]

[DIALOGUE]I'll come with you.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]There wasn't a fire. There'll be nothing for you to do.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I'll learn something.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]This isn't homicide school.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]My parents are from Poland. I can help with the Eastern European angle.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You're Polish?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]My folks are.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]

[DIALOGUE]Million?! The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]VENDOR[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview. And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her? It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]EMIL[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yes. Both.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]OLEG[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]And these.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]There was too much press hangin' around there. I didn't want her face on the news. So I told him to take her to a quiet area until things settled down.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DUFFY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Oh.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]It was my decision, not his.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DUFFY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it. I mean, to say the least, you outta know better. You don't know her well enough.

[CHARACTER]JORDY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody? I mean, you shoulda heard her there. Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]EDDIE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer. Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer. That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that. You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case. And lemme give you another piece of advice. Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television. And when you get out there, they know your face. And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job. And I get more done because of it.[/DIALOGUE]

Eddie comes up and around again at Oleg who is coming at him from the wall. Eddie knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa. Falling on top of him, rolling over and leaving Oleg on the sofa. Eddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the gun.

Oleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to turn toward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in the stomach. Emil steps back, revealing the knife is BURIED IN EDDIE'S STOMACH. Eddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to the chair - holding the gun. Eddie can't believe he got stabbed.
