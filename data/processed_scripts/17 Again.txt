[CHARACTER]MIKE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]A little late for a delivery isn't it?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]SCARLET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Dom was in the neighborhood. He offered to make a dump run for me.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]SCARLET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I'm gonna use it as a showpiece for clients. Thanks for asking.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MIKE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Kind of a big undertaking isn't it?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]SCARLET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I am a landscape designer. Then again you barely took an interest in my work so I guess that's a fair question.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]An awkward silence. Then-[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MIKE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I didn't get it.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]SCARLET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I'm sorry. But maybe this is what you needed. Maybe it's time you looked for something else?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MIKE[/CHARACTER]

[ACTION]Scarlet throws the shovel to the ground.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]SCARLET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]And it's all my fault, isn't it?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MIKE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I didn't say that.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]SCARLET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No, but it's what you think, right?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Mike's silence says it all. Scarlet fights back tears.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]SCARLET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I never asked you to marry me.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MIKE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]But I did.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]MIKE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]ED[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]That's a good sign. We can eliminate Satan. I think what we're dealing with here is a spell of enlightenment. "Spell affect"..."casting procedure"...yada, yada, yada. Basically it's a learning spell. There's something you need to figure out and until you do you'll stay a kid. My guess is that janitor was probably a war...[/DIALOGUE]

[ACTION]Stan and his Posse tap fists. Mike dribbles between his legs.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MIKE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]But, People, Stan's a bully. Why? It would be way too easy to say Stan preys on the weak because he's simply a dick. No, Stan's more complex than that. According to leading psychiatrists Stan is a bully for 1 of 3 reasons. 1, under all that male bravado there's an insecure little girl banging on the closet door trying to get out. 2, like a caveman, Stan's brain is underdeveloped. Therefore Stan is unable to use self-control so he acts out aggressively. And the third reason-[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]MIKE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Thank you, your Honor. September 7th, 1988 was the first time I saw you. You were reading `The Great Gatsby' and wearing a Guns N Roses T-shirt. I'd never seen anything so perfect. I remember thinking I had to have you or I'd die...not in a psycho kinda way but in that beautiful, innocent, unaffected way that way only a 17 year-old kid can have. You whispered you loved me at the homecoming dance and I felt so peaceful and safe because I knew no matter what happened from that night on nothing could ever be that bad because I had you. And then I grew up, lost my way and blamed you for my failures. But I was never lost. I'd just forgotten the way life makes you forget as you grow older. And I never failed at anything because on that September day you said `yes' to me. And at that dance you said you loved me. And as I stand here...as I write this, I want you to know if I don't have you I'll die...not in a psycho way but in that beautiful, innocent, unaffected way only a 17 year old kid can have....oh and...P.S...I'm `Hungry Like the Wolf'.[/DIALOGUE]
