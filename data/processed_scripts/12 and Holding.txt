It was as if I had just gotten out of college! I was fearless! I went after accounts I had avoided for years because I thought they were out of my league. I spoke to presidents, vice presidents, business managers, sales reps. I was amazing. I was magic. But when I came home to share the news with your mother, I discovered her asleep. When I looked around the house, I realized that her "office", for lack of a better word, was also piled up. So, I took to the house. I have made it my duty to clean this place from top to bottom.

[CHARACTER]LEONARD[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Anytime I mention it, my mother goes crazy.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]JACOB[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]If you really want her to drop a few tons, put her in jail. Kenny's lost about 30 pounds since he's been incarcerated, and he was already thin.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]LEONARD[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Really?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]JACOB[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yeah. Jail is the perfect weight loss program. You take a fat tub, throw them in a room and force them to eat right and exercise. Don't let them out till they do.[/DIALOGUE]

[ACTION]Malee smiles at Gus. He knows where this is going, and he's suddenly nervous.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]GUS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You don't want somebody that much older than you. An age difference can cause problems.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MALEE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What kind of problems?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]GUS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]A lot of times when a couple has an age difference, they wind up splitting up because they want different things.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MALEE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You mean sex.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]GUS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Gus catches a look of relief on Malee's face. GUS (cont'd) I mean, yeah. You may be 13, but a boy even three years older than you is probably more "experienced". Boys can be impatient about that sort of thing.[/ACTION]

[CHARACTER]MALEE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]How old was she?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]GUS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]About my age.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MALEE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]See that, age wasn't an issue, yet you still wanted different things. I don't think it's about age.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]MALEE (cont'd) I think when two people connect, they connect for other reasons. And since soulmates are eternal, they have no age. Gus is stumped.[/ACTION]
