[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No, sir, he is not.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I try to be.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles crosses towards them. It takes a while.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I appreciate your coming on such short notice.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Mrs. Christian holds out her hand and Welles takes it.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]This is Mister Longdale, my late husband's attorney.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles shakes Longdale's limp hand, looking him over.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Uh huh, pleasure.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]LONGDALE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yes, I do have something to say. I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I'm listening.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]LONGDALE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Of what sort?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]LONGDALE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You are a private investigator?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]That's right.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]LONGDALE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yes, how theatrical. So you've gone on the record, and now perhaps you should just be gone.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Longdale's irritated, but has no choice. He walks away.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Have a pleasant evening. Will you have tea, Mister Welles?[/DIALOGUE]

[DIALOGUE]Thank you.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Mrs. Christian begins pouring tea from the service on a table. Welles watches Longdale exit.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]

[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]He's a lawyer. Please, sit, here...[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles accepts a dainty tea cup and saucer, taking a seat.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey. Asking about you. I must say you have friends in influential places.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You are highly recommended. Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles nods, sipping tea.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]As you know, my husband passed away recently. Two weeks ago now.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]

[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Not many people have been inside this room.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles examines PHOTOS of Mr. Christian visiting various STEEL PLANTS, COAL MINES and ground-breaking ceremonies, shaking hands with WORKMEN, with POLITICIANS.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Pittsburgh?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Mostly. That's where he started his empire building. He was a good man. Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated. He wanted to be legendary.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]He succeeded.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine. We had our troubles. There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him. I loved him deeply.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles waits.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to. Other than that, there's never any reason.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Just curious.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Mrs. Christian crosses to take down a PICTURE, revealing a WALL SAFE. The safe is ajar, burnt and scarred, broken into.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe. I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business. Not till now, that is.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You hired someone to open it. I'll bet the lawyer loved that.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]There was nothing he could do. My husband left everything to me. I prevented anyone from seeing the contents. I felt these were my husband's private things. I didn't... I didn't realize...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Do you want to tell me what you found?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Cash, stock certificates, and this...[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]She takes something from her pocket, puts it on the desk: a plastic bag containing a short 8MM FILM on a plastic reel.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]It's a film... of a girl being murdered.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I'm afraid I don't...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]This is a movie showing a girl being murdered. She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife... I only watched what I could.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles picks up the film, looks at it.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I didn't know what to think. I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband. To know that he watched this... this atrocity. But, I can't go to the police...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment? I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film." But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth. Like, red light district folklore. There's no such thing, I can assure you.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Mrs. Christian shakes her head.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Please, believe me. This is probably a stag film. Simulated rape. Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I'm telling you it's not that.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I'm sure it is. It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke. More than likely he never even watched it.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Will you watch it and see for yourself?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Of course. But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.[/DIALOGUE]

[SCENE]INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT[/SCENE]
[ACTION]An 8MM PROJECTOR faces a wall. Welles looks back to Mrs. Christian in the doorway. Mrs. Christian leaves, shuts the door. Darkness. Welles turns on the projector and sits. The PROJECTOR CLATTERS, shooting bright images... ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, over exposure, then... the grainy FILM is HAND HELD, constantly in motion, showing a skinny GIRL, 16 or 17, in a negligee, sitting on a bed in a nondescript room with little furniture. Looks like a hotel room. We only ever see three walls. The once beautiful girl looks worn, drugged, dark circles under her eyes, staring blankly. The CAMERA'S tungsten SPOTLIGHT casts long, shifting shadows as the camera moves, but the girl still stares oblivious. The bed is wrapped in PLASTIC and DUCT TAPE. The floor is covered by PLASTIC SHEETING... Welles watches, crossing his arms, already uncomfortable. ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a bathroom, and a MASKED MAN enters. The Masked Man wears a garish, Mexican WRESTLING MASK with eye holes and a mouth. The mask covers his entire head. He's naked except for red shorts, his body scrawny, oiled, pale. The man goes to stand in front of the girl. He seems to be saying something to her, but the film is silent and the ONLY SOUND is the PROJECTOR'S LOUD sprocket hole CLATTER. It's all one long take. The CAMERA MOVES to favor the girl... Welles sits straight in his chair, wary. ON THE WALL: Masked Man raises his open hand and SLAPS the girl, knocking her back on the bed... Welles grimaces. ON THE WALL: Masked Man pulls the girl back to a seated position. The girl's like a rag doll, face reddened, eyes closed, but she remains upright. Masked Man uses his thumbs to open her unseeing eyes. He touches her mouth with his fingers, presses his lips to hers. Then, Masked Man backs away, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid out. Masked Man runs his fingers over the blades... Welles rises slowly, still watching. ON THE WALL: Masked Man selects a huge Bowie knife and moves back towards the girl... Welles crosses his arms tight, disbelieving, fearful. WE WILL NEVER SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THE FILM, but Welles does. In the flickering, reflected light, Welles backs involuntarily away from the horrible images, holding his fist to his mouth, breathing hard. Welles keeps backing away, till he's backed against a wall. The PROJECTOR'S CLATTERING. Welles is sickened, sweating, still watching, till he finally shuts his eyes.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, ADJOINING ROOM -- NIGHT[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Silence. Mrs. Christian sits waiting, troubled. The door to the dining room opens and Welles enters from the dark, visibly shaken. Mrs. Christian watches him, her sorrow now shared.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You... you need to go to the police.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I told you I can't, not yet.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You don't have any other choice.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No. For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police. I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]It won't work like that.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously. I've thought about it and there's no other way. If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen. I'm telling you I won't. If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles sits, rests his head in his hands.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I deal in divorce cases. Corporate investigations...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You've found missing persons before.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Nothing remotely like this.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS CHRISTIAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I know what I'm asking. Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk. You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it. I feel responsible, Mr. Welles. You saw what he did to her.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles stands, torn apart and uncertain, looks back to the dining room where the projector sits idle.[/ACTION]

[DIALOGUE]Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing. It's better that way.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]AMY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I know.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]It's a missing persons case... a long shot. I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back. We'll take a vacation.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]AMY[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Why the gun?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]

[ACTION]Welles comes out of the makeshift darkroom, holding a PHOTO of the girl. He props the photo up on a dresser, stands looking at it. Sad girl, staring forward. Welles goes to pick up his CELLULAR PHONE, dials.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, OFFICES -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Small. Cubicles. Employees work phones and computers. BULLETIN BOARDS are covered in FAMILY PHOTOS, Polaroids and familiar "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?" missing person/children POSTERS. IN ONE CUBICLE, Welles opens his billfold, shows his identification: a laminated "LICENSED INVESTIGATOR, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania", with WELLES' PHOTO... The DIRECTOR of the center, a tired looking official in bifocals, studies the card. Welles sits.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]DIRECTOR[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Call me Tom.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DIRECTOR[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Alright, Tom.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive. And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DIRECTOR[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]There are reasons for the way we do things here.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Absolutely. Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]The director sits back in his chair.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife. What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe. They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city. Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone. Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself... That's the last they saw her. The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch... They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DIRECTOR[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I figured you share information.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DIRECTOR[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]We do.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DIRECTOR[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Why don't they come to me?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved. They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever. Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DIRECTOR[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I'm not so sure about this.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DIRECTOR[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles accepts a CARD, disappointed.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DIRECTOR[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Well, that's all I can do. Sorry.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles looks at the director, stands, hangs his head.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Who knows... maybe she's already given her parents a call, right?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles leaves.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]EXT. OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles comes out the front doors, pissed.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Fuck.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]He tears the card in half and drops it as he heads for his car. After a moment, the director comes out after him...[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]DIRECTOR[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Excuse me... Tom, hold on...[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles looks back, walks back, glances down... makes sure he stands on the torn card, hiding it underfoot.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]DIRECTOR[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Listen, maybe I can help after all. Why don't you come on back in... we'll see what we can do.[/DIALOGUE]

[SCENE]INT. MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Director leads Welles into this RESEARCH ROOM, a small library with long tables, old COMPUTERS, lots of FILE CABINETS and CARD CATALOGS. Secretaries tend to the files.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]DIRECTOR[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]This is it. It's not much. We've got less than five percent on computer and we lose that funding in December. I'll have someone show it to you anyway. Other than that, I'm afraid it's the wet thumb method.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles looks to the many, many file drawers.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]DIRECTOR[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance. We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Any good?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DIRECTOR[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days. I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DIRECTOR[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]It's good what you're doing.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]The director puts out his hand. Welles looks, shakes.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE[/SCENE]
[ACTION]ON A COMPUTER SCREEN: files open and close -- PICTURE after PICTURE of a MISSING CHILDREN, mostly teenagers, each with physical description, age, date of disappearance, etc. Lost souls, although these are posed portraits, high school yearbook photos and vacation photos, so the children are mostly smiling, happy and healthy. But, all "MISSING." Welles works the computer keyboard and mouse... ON THE SCREEN: the FACES of TEENAGERS, boys and girls, one after the other, MISSING... MISSING... MISSING...[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- DAY -- MONTAGE[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles searches the SHELVES of the LIBRARY. He begins taking down various books... "Motion Picture Photography." "Film Stocks and Physical Characteristics." "Super 8 Filmmaking."[/ACTION]

[ACTION]In Welles' notepad: "SUPRAlux 544." Welles sits paging through technical photography books.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded through the projector. He turns the CLATTERING projector on and sits, watching. ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, then... the skinny GIRL in a negligee, sitting on the bed. The CAMERA'S SPOTLIGHT casts long shadows. The girl stares, oblivious... ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a bathroom, and the MASKED MAN enters, wearing the ghastly WRESTLING MASK. The man goes to stand in front of the girl. He seems to be saying something. The FILM halts. Welles sits forward, hand on the projector. He's seen something. He PLAYS the FILM in REVERSE... ON THE WALL: the Masked Man walks backwards, away from the girl, backwards into the bathroom, door shutting... Welles stops the projector, not taking his eyes from the image. He ADVANCES the film FRAME BY FRAME... FRAME BY FRAME... as the bathroom door opens, and the Masked Man enters... FRAME BY FRAME... as the Masked Man moves forward... door closing behind him... STOP... FREEZE FRAME: a THIRD MAN is reflected in the bathroom mirror. Grainy and blurred, but he's in the room with the girl, standing there, captured in the mirror in this one brief instant just before the bathroom door closes. Welles walks to take a closer look, studying the almost ethereal image of the Third Man.[/ACTION]

[ACTION]Welles is in a PHONE BOOTH, feeds many quarters into the phone, waiting, looking at his notepad.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Hello, Mrs. Christian? Tom Welles. Here's where we stand. I checked the film stock and it's called Supra- lux 544. The company that made that stock discontinued it in '92... Yeah, about five or six years ago. Anyway, do what you can to dig up your husband's old financial records, look for anything out of the ordinary...[/DIALOGUE]

[SCENE]INT. MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles is back at the computer, alone, drinking coffee. ON THE COMPUTER: endless PHOTOS of MISSING CHILDREN. The PHONE CALL CONTINUES in VOICE OVER: WELLES (V.O., cont) Nobody really uses eight millimeter film anymore, so we can assume there are reasons our guys did. First, they could develop it themselves if they had any sort of expertise. Obviously, this isn't the kind of movie you can just drop off at the one-hour photo...[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles just stands, staring at the PHOTO of the GIRL. WELLES (V.O., cont) Second, the film that went through the camera is what we've got. There's no negative. Unlike video, it wasn't meant to be duplicated. No reason for them to risk having more than one copy of their murder floating around...[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. CLEVELAND BAR -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Local bar. Welles sits drinking with the archive's director, talking, smiling at something the director said. WELLES (V.O., cont) There don't seen to be many fingerprints on the film itself, but I'm going to have to be careful to leave them intact...[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles is tired, unshaven. He's moved on to the physical files, at one table, looking through HUNDREDS of MISSING PERSON BULLETINS. Secretaries tend to other files. WELLES (V.O., cont) It's okay for yours and your husbands fingerprints to be on the film, but you'll have to use me as a middleman if you go to the police. That way I don't have to explain why my prints are on it...[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. WELLES' ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles sits with the PROJECTOR ON, watching the film again. WELLES (V.O., cont) There were three men. Two are obvious; the man in the mask and the man running the camera, but I caught a glimpse of a third man in a mirror. It's nothing that can be used for identification, but he was there, watching... ON THE WALL: Masked Man touches the girl's mouth, presses his lips to hers. Masked Man backs away, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid out... Welles notices something, puts the projector on FREEZE FRAME. WELLES (V.O., cont) So, there were three. They would have kept it small, wouldn't have let anyone in on it they didn't have to. That's all for now... except, I feel I should tell you... with this looking like it happened at least five or six years ago... Welles walks to the frozen IMAGE on the wall. It shows the Masked Man's hands in frame, fingering the blades. WELLES (V.O., cont) Well, it's not very likely we'll ever find out who this girl was. (listens) I will, I'll keep trying. Goodbye. V.O. PHONE CALL ends with the SOUND of the PHONE HANGING UP. ON THE WALL: there's a DARK SPOT on Masked Man's hand, on the arch between his index finger and thumb. Grainy and hard to make out, but looks like a small TATTOO.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. WELLES ROOM, BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- END MONTAGE[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded into his photo enlarger, projecting the IMAGE we just saw down onto the baseboard. He re-frames, CLOSER ON the masked Man's hand, REFOCUSING... the black spot is a little clearer, looks like a small STAR tattoo on the back of Masked Man's hand.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles sits hunched over the card catalog, still unshaven, drinking coffee, flipping through smaller PICTURES of MISSING CHILDREN in one drawer, one by one by one... Welles rolls his neck. He looks to see the archive's director in the doorway. The director nods, leaving. Welles gets back to it, stooped over the catalog.[/ACTION]
[ACTION]TITLE CARD: three weeks later[/ACTION]

[SCENE]EXT. OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]In the lot, Welles gets wearily from his car, smoking. He tosses the cigarette, gets a Thermos off the front seat.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles pulls out a card catalog drawer labeled "North Carolina 1992," flipping through picture cards. The FACES of TEENAGERS: a happy BOY with blue eyes... a red headed GIRL with freckles... a ruddy faced BOY... a pretty GIRL with a ribbon in her hair... a black GIRL in a pink dress... a blonde haired BOY with curly hair... Welles furrows his brow. He backtracks to the pretty GIRL with the ribbon in her hair. Welles sits straight. He reaches into his pocket, hands shaking a little, takes out and unfolds the PHOTO he printed of the girl from the snuff film. It's her. Welles compares the two pictures. She's prettier in the card catalog photo, but it's her. Welles can't believe it, looks around. Secretaries at other files don't even know he's there. Welles pulls out his notepad, scribbling down INFORMATION off the card... Writing the girl's name: "Mary Anne Matthews."[/ACTION]

He drums his fingers, opens the glove compartment, pulls out the car's registration, other papers and "Jiffy-Lube" service reports, uses them to pad the file. Welles takes a BOTTLE of COLOGNE from his pocket. He considers it, opens the bottle, applies cologne to his neck.[/ACTION]

[DIALOGUE]Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit. If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I don't understand, who are... ?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington. I'm sure you've dealt with them before?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yes, but...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations... ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different. I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually. I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles pretends to look for the name on a Jiffy Lube page...[/ACTION]

[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Neil... Neil Cole.[/DIALOGUE]

[DIALOGUE]They hired you. You're like, a private detective?[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat. Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh? And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Mrs. Mathews smiles.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]It's refreshing to actually sit down and meet someone face to face, someone nice like you.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles smiles. Mrs. Mathews takes out a cigarette. Welles lights her, joins her in smoking, refers to his clipboard.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]So, she didn't leave a note? She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]She just seemed... depressed... ?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]She didn't seem herself. For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it. One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone. She took some clothes.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yes.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]September 4th, 1993. About a year after Mary disappeared.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]We were divorced by then. Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Why do you think he did it?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]It got to be too much for him.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter... Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never. My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I didn't mean to...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I had to ask. I apologize.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No one knows what it's like. You can't even imagine how much it hurts.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles is miserable. A few CUSTOMERS walk past, looking at Mrs. Mathews. She tries not to notice then noticing.[/ACTION]

[ACTION]Welles takes a few steps into the room, looks down at a DESK where there are SIX brightly wrapped GIFTS. MRS MATHEWS Those are for her birthday. One for every year she's missed. They'll be waiting for her when she comes back. Welles is nearly overwhelmed by sadness, struggling to hide it. He backs to the door, looks at his watch...[/ACTION]

[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]We weren't religious. We never forced religion down her throat, like I've seen some parents do to their kids. We never made her go to church. But, after Mary was gone, that's when I got religious.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Mrs. Mathews brings two cups of coffee, sits.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother. Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time. That's when you start going to church.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]We're all like that.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons. When kids run, they almost always leave a note. It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]There wasn't one. The police looked.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Do you think the police did a good job?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I don't know. I think so.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it. She might have wanted to tell you something...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]No. You don't have any reason to think that...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]MRS MATHEWS[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go. Police are just as human as you or I. They could have missed something. They probably didn't. Wouldn't you rather know?[/DIALOGUE]

MATHEWS' BEDROOM, Welles looks through DRESSER drawers, methodically, replacing everything as it was... searches hat boxes and shoe boxes in a CLOSET... takes BOOKS off SHELVES, fanning the pages, shaking them out... -In a BATHROOM, Welles examines the contents of a MEDICINE CABINET, examining old prescription bottles... opens CABINETS under the sink... -In the LIVING ROOM, Mrs. Mathews sits slumped in a chair, staring at a soap opera on TELEVISION, a BOTTLE of scotch on TV tray beside her, drink in hand. -In the KITCHEN, Welles stands on a chair, searches high CABINETS... looks through low CABINETS, on his knees, pulls out pots and pans... fans the pages of COOK BOOKS... -Welles stands in the doorway of MARY'S ROOM, just stares. He takes a few steps back into the HALLWAY, looks up at the ceiling. There's an ATTIC DOOR there. Welles reaches to the door's handle, opens it, unfolds the portable stairs... -In the small ATTIC, Welles uses a penlight FLASHLIGHT, crouched under the low ceiling, looking through dusty BOXES of PHOTOGRAPHS; old photos of a wedding, of grandparents... Welles moves to pull back dusty sheets, finds a large WICKER BASKET and broken BICYCLE underneath... Welles opens the basket, takes out BLANKETS and QUILTS in mothballs. He finds a wide VELVET BOX, takes it out, opens its hinged lid to reveal a set of good SILVERWARE. He touches the tarnished silverware, lifts out the top tray. Underneath, resting on top of more silverware, is a DIARY. Welles opens the DIARY, finds written: "Mary Anne Mathews." Welles turns pages. The DIARY'S about half-full of feminine, cursive handwriting. After the last written page, a PAGE has been TORN OUT. Welles fingers the ragged edge, flips through the blank pages till he comes to the very last page, a GOODBYE NOTE. Welles sits and reads...[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MARY'S VOICE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]"Dear mom. If you're reading this, it means I called you from Hollywood, California and told you where to find my diary. I don't think I'll be able to tell you this when I talk to you, so I'm writing it down here. You know I haven't been happy for a long, long time. For a long time now dad's been doing things I couldn't tell you. He's been touching me and it's getting worse. I can't stay anymore. I know you and I haven't always gotten along sometimes, but please don't blame yourself. There isn't anything you can do. I'm going to make a whole new life in California. Maybe someday you'll see me on TV or in magazines. Don't worry about me. Love, Mary Anne."[/DIALOGUE]

Walls are covered in videos, sex toys, inflatable women, etc. CUSTOMERS, again all wary males, follow proper porn-shop etiquette; look at the porn, not your fellow shopper. There are "PEEP SHOW" booths in the back. A MAN looks around, trying to be nonchalant, sweating profusely, slipping behind one curtain. Welles pretends to read the packaging on a triple-pack of dildos, looks towards the front... Behind the register, Max takes a look to make sure the other clerk is busy, takes the cap of his Highlighter pen and highlights a section in the book he's reading. Welles notes this. He goes to the substantial MAGAZINE RACK, picks up a porn tabloid, pages through it. He selects sex MAGAZINES and NEWSPAPERS, choosing about twenty-five. Welles takes this pile up to Max, gets out his wallet. Max starts ringing everything up.[/ACTION]

[ACTION]Max and Welles enter through the double doors, into a kind of small, underground porn flea market. It's incredibly quiet. About fifteen CARD TABLES are set up in rows. The MEN behind the tables and the thirty or so "CUSTOMERS" looking through the merchandise make those in the previous porn shops look like high society. These are MIDDLE-AGED MEN, most balding, some with pot bellies, in shorts and tube socks, in sweatpants and Members Only jackets: plain men, but with a look of desperation in their eyes, glancing around nervously, greasy and afraid.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]ONE DEALER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]We're shutting down in fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles makes his way to the tables, wary. One table is covered in dirty cardboard boxes, filled with HUNDREDS of PHOTOS of young children, mostly boys, naked. Each photo is wrapped in plastic, censored by masking tape. Welles swallows back disgust. The next table is piled high with used pornographic MAGAZINES. There are baggies with COLORFUL PILLS laid out. X-rated Polaroids wrapped in rubberbands. Max follows behind, unaffected, smokes a cigarette. Another table offers VIDEO TAPES with no identifying marks other than hand written labels with numbers written out, "two," "sixteen," "five." And many bootleg VIDEOS with grainy, homemade labels showing WOMEN in extreme BONDAGE. Welles watches out the corner of his eye as the PLUMP MAN beside him pays for a thick stack of kiddie porn pictures. Welles waits till the man moves on, addresses the angry looking DEALER who's counting money.[/ACTION]

[DIALOGUE]What you see is what I got, mister.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You know where I can get it? I have a lot of money to spend.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]ANGRY DEALER[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]The dealer sits and keeps counting cash. Welles moves on Beyond the tables there's a CURTAINED DOORWAY. Welles walks to it, enters... INSIDE THE CURTAIN Folding chairs face a SCREEN. A PROJECTOR shows a silent movie; a BUXOM WOMAN in nurses uniform prepares an enema bag and tube. A hairy, overweight MAN lays face down on an examination table, naked, arms tied behind his back. In the darkness, a MAN shifts in his chair, grunting, obviously masturbating. A few chairs away, a man is bent over, moving his head in the lap of SOMEONE in a BLONDE WIG. A LARGE MAN approaches Welles from the dark.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]LARGE MAN[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You have to pay to come in here.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles backs away, shuts the curtain.[/ACTION]

[ACTION]Not many people in the place. Welles drinks coffee. Max eats a huge breakfast.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MAX[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc. Nobody even considers them pornography anymore. Then, there's mainstream hardcore. Triple X. The difference is penetration. That's hardcore. That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are. They pump out 150 videos a week. A week. They've even got a porno Academy Awards. America loves pornography. Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying. Somebody's buying those videos. Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex. Know what else? It's only gonna get worse. More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution. Desensitization. Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive! Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out. Know what I mean? For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while. They have to be the biggest tits ever. Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally. Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Interesting theory.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MAX[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend. We're talking about stuff where people get hurt. Specialty product.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Child pornography.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MAX[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal. Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal. This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love. Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line. How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not? Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn. Rape films, but there aren't many. I've never seen one.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Snuff films.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MAX[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I heard you asking. That guy wasn't yanking you around. There's no such thing.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What other ways are there to get illegal films? Who do you see?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MAX[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer. It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet. Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants. It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em. But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes. No one knows where it comes from. That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth. Those are zombies, hardcore junkies. Their hands are permanently pruned. They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister. Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes. Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations. Interstate wire transfers. Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows? That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal. There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]MAX[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed. What are you talking about?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MAX[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yeah, I'm a real genius. What choices have I got? Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it. I work a job. It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.[/DIALOGUE]

Elevator doors open on the SECOND FLOOR. The two women get out and walk down a grey hallway, towards DOUBLE DOORS painted black. Welles stops the elevator door from closing. The women push the INTERCOM at the black doors. Another dull BUZZ is HEARD as the women enter. The low rumble of HEAVY METAL MUSIC is HEARD, SILENCED as doors swing shut.

[SCENE]INT. WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles is lit by the flicker from the TELEVISION SCREEN. WE SEE NOTHING. We HEAR the rhythmic MUFFLED MOANS of a WOMAN from the TV, can't tell if it's pleasure or pain. Max is asleep in the bed, PIZZA BOX near his feet. Welles drinks beer, gets up and ejects the CASSETTE from a VCR, tosses it aside, tired. He picks another Dino Velvet TAPE, puts it in, sits. ON TV: GOTHIC ROCK is HEARD over old, scratchy IMAGES: of Klansmen around a burning cross... Dracula menacing a sleeping woman... a man in a Devil costume dancing... Welles opens another beer. ON TV: a WOMAN is tied up, arms in the air, hanging from the ceiling, gagged and blindfolded, in a dungeon lit by candelabras. Then, glimpsed IMAGES: worms writhing in slime... gargoyles... a guillotine falling. Then, the bound woman, struggling. A MASKED MAN in a leather jacket enters. He wears a LEATHER MASK with zipper eyes and mouth... This focuses Welles' attention. ON TV: the Masked Man circles the captured woman...[/ACTION]

[CHARACTER]MAX[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Why? He have something to do with whatever you're into?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Still watching the behemoth on TV, Welles is less sure. ON TV: the bulging Masked Man flexes, ripped.[/ACTION]

[ACTION]Welles rubs his eyes, sits back. Max sits up, watching. ON TV: Masked Man pulls the bound woman's head back by her hair, licks her face with his thick tongue... CLOSE ON: Masked Man grips the woman's head, still licking. He pulls down the woman's blindfold... Welles sits forward, realizing, horrified... Welles goes to the VCR, hits PAUSE. The IMAGE on TV FREEZES. Welles goes back, FRAME by FRAME... ... to the CLOSE UP where Masked Man grips the woman's face. FREEZE FRAME. On Masked Man's hand: a TATTOO, on the arch between his forefinger and thumb, same as the scrawny Masked Man in the snuff film. A PENTAGRAM TATTOO.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Who is he?[/DIALOGUE]

[DIALOGUE]Nobody knows his name. That's his thing. He always wears a mask. You never see his face. He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him. Machine.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles hits PLAY. On TV, Masked Man runs his hands up and down the woman's body. The woman's eyes are filled with fear. Welles sits, unnerved, watching.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MAX[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]They say he's half brain-dead from all the steroids he's using.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Max rolls over, trying to get back to sleep.[/ACTION]

[DIALOGUE]You're in the wrong place.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]We're looking for Mr. Velvet.[/DIALOGUE]

[SCENE]INT. DINO VELVET'S OFFICE -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Thug opens the door and lets Welles and Max in. The office is huge, windowless walls covered in thousands of PICTURES from every conceivable source, torn and cut, pinned up to form an indecipherable collage. A tall LADDER leans against one wall, near three TELEVISIONS. DINO VELVET rises behind his desk, a small, bird-like man, wearing a black suit and bad hairpiece.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Come in. Make yourself comfortable.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles shakes Dino's hand. Max looks up at the walls. IMAGES; porn pictures, news photos, world leaders, autopsy photos, armies and insects, the naked and the dead.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]It's an honor to meet you. Thank you for seeing us.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What can I do for you today?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles sits. Shelves behind Dino's desk are piled high with VIDEO CASSETTES, old MOVIE CAMERAS, big REELS of 16mm FILM. VIDEOS and MAGAZINES are stacked everywhere.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I'd like to commission a work. I'm a great admirer of yours.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Flattering. And, who's your colorful little chum?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]A fellow investor.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Hmm.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]MAX[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You're the only one still shooting film and transferring it to video. Nobody appreciates that kind of integrity anymore... the grain, the gritty look you get.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Well, I'm glad you appreciate it. What would you say is your favorite piece?[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles considers. Max glances over, looks back to the walls.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]MAX[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Dino grins, showing yellowed teeth.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You said something about money.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yes. What we're looking for is rather specific.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles takes out an ENVELOPE, puts it on the desk.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]That's five thousand dollars.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Is it?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course. Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]And they are?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I want to watch you work.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I'll consider it.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Machine.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]If it's not him, there's no deal.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Dino drums his painted fingernails on his lips.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]We can do that.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit? Very good.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Dino stands, picks up a still CAMERA off his desk and comes to look at Welles, studying him.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it. I'd like to take your picture. You don't mind?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I'd rather you didn't.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]What's the problem?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]I'm camera shy.[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?[/DIALOGUE]
[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Those are two different kinds of trust. Thank you for your time. I hope we can do business.[/DIALOGUE]

[ACTION]Welles climbs crumbling concrete stairs, looking all directions, crossing a LOADING DOCK towards a DOOR...[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles enters slowly, trying to get his eyes to adjust to the darkness. A vast, empty space looms before him. In the middle of the warehouse, Dino Velvet stands, in a powder blue suit, holding an archery BOW and ARROW.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]There you are. Come join us.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]There's a wrought IRON BED not far from Dino. MACHINE is seated on the mattress, a huge man, wearing a leather S+M harness and the same WRESTLING MASK as in the snuff film. Welles gathers his courage, walks towards them. Dino pulls back on the bow, aiming away across the warehouse. He stands by a TABLE with a QUIVER of ARROWS propped up. He shoots an arrow toward a large TARGET... Strikes the target dead center, BULL'S-EYE. As Welles gets closer, he notices several things ... ... a 16MM CAMERA mounted on a TRIPOD, facing the bed, along with several movie LIGHTS ... several BOWIE KNIFES are laid out on the table, beside a pair of HANDCUFFS... ... Machine is watching him as he approaches... Welles stops, not far from Dino and Machine, but keeping his distance. Dino's still firing arrows at the target.

[ACTION]Machine just stares at him with bloodshot eyes.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]

[ACTION]Dino pulls arrows from the target.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]He was saying how fascinated he is by their simple ability to be sharp. The ability of a piece of metal to be so thin that it is almost nothing...[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Dino walks back to the table, replaces the arrows in the quiver, cueing another arrow in is bow.[/ACTION]
[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]So close to nothingness that it cuts with minimum effort, because it's so non-intrusive. Flesh is fooled. It blooms open as the blade widens, but by then it's too late, because the knife's already doing its pure, simple damage.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Dino shoots another arrow to the target. A CLATTER attracts Welles attention. Far across the warehouse, a DELIVERY DOOR rolls upwards. A CAR with tinted windows drives in...

[CHARACTER]DINO VELVET[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Ah, ours guests have arrived.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Machine stands. He is a giant. Welles takes a few steps back, wary, sweating hard now. The car parks across the warehouse, not far from the target. Dino puts another arrow in his bow, pulls it taunt, aims at the target... turns, aims the arrow at Welles.[/ACTION]

[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy. And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film. That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]LONGDALE[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Isn't it incredibly obvious?[/DIALOGUE]

[ACTION]The only SOUNDS come from the NIGHT FOREST. CRICKETS and distant BIRDS. We can't see anything but the TOTAL DARKNESS through the open door of the room. A CAR is HEARD, getting LOUDER as it passes, FAINTER as it gets further away. Finally, Welles comes to the doorway, in shock, steadying himself against the door frame, shirt and suit spattered red. His gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood. Welles looks back into the room, backing away. He turns and goes to his car... IN THE CAR Welles climbs in the driver's side, shoves his bloody gun into his holster, tries to wipe blood from his hand onto his shirt, revolted. He starts the car.[/ACTION]

[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Hello, can you connect me with the duty nurse? Hello, this is Lieutenant Anderson down here in the Thirteenth Precinct. I've got a helluva problem I was hoping you could give me a hand with. We had a stabbing incident a couple of days ago, and it looks like the supposed victim gave us a false name and address. Can you tell me if you had an adult male with an abdominal wound in you ER in the last forty-eight hours? You'd remember this guy; a body- builder, real big guy, five foot eleven, with acne all over his chest and back... Alright, thanks for your help.[/DIALOGUE]

[CHARACTER]WELLES[/CHARACTER]
[DIALOGUE]Yes... yes. Christopher Higgins. Thirty- fifteen, Thirty Fifth Street. Where? Astoria, Queens.[/DIALOGUE]
[ACTION]Welles is scribbling all this down in his notepad.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]EXT. QUEENS STREET -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]A relatively quiet residential street. HOMES are small, two story affairs, close together, each very much like its neighbor, some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls. Welles' Ford comes slowly down the street. CHILDREN in school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups. Welles parallel parks. IN THE CAR Welles turns off the engine. He's watching a HOUSE on the other side of the street. The house is brick on the bottom, aluminum siding on top, quaint, with brick staircase from the front door down to a GARAGE underneath, plastic PINK FLAMINGOS on the small lawn. Cars pass in the street. Welles watches school children pass on the near sidewalk. He slumps down a little in his seat, adjusting the rearview mirror, adjusting his side mirror, rolling up the window. Welles takes a cautionary look around, takes out his gun, pours bullets out and pockets them. He picks up a PAPER BAG off the passenger seat and opens it. He takes out a long, thin metal FILE, pulling off the shrink wrap packaging, feels the file with his thumb. Keeping his open gun low under the steering wheel, Welles slides the file into the barrel, scraping gently all along the gun's inner barrel.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. WELLES' CAR -- LATER DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles sits smoking a cigarette, watching the quaint house. He looks in his side mirror... There's a large CAR coming down the block with its turn signal on. Welles slumps a little lower. The car passes, slowing. The GARAGE DOOR of the quaint house begins to open. Welles watches... Can't really see the driver of the car except for the back of his head, but he's huge. It's a good bet it's Machine. Beside him in the passenger seat is a GREY HAIRED OLD WOMAN. The car pulls into the darkness of the quaint house's garage. After a moment, the OLD WOMAN comes from the garage, walks with a cane, wears glasses. She goes to the sidewalk, checks her MAILBOX, finds it empty. Welles watches. The old woman goes back to the garage. She goes inside. The garage door closes behind her.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. WELLES' CAR -- NIGHT[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles still watches the house. There's a light on in one of the second floor windows, curtains closed. Welles yawns, shaking his head, trying to stay awake. At the quaint house, a light comes on in the front picture window. Looks like a living room or dining room. The old woman comes to sit at a table. Welles takes binoculars off the front seat... THROUGH BINOCULARS The old woman says something to someone we cannot see. She's at the dinner table, with a place setting in front of her. After a moment, someone joins her... It's Machine, you can tell by his bulk, by his huge forearms. The lacy curtains of the window block part of our view, so we never see his face. IN THE CAR Welles lowers the binoculars, still watching. Through the window across the street, Machine can be seen putting a plate of food in front of the old woman. The old woman smiles up at him, says something. Machine goes to light two candles on the table with matches, then goes back to stand beside the old woman. Machine is seen from behind, bends to give the old woman a kiss on the cheek, then leaves the room. The old woman starts to eat.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. WELLES' CAR -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Dawn light is just breaking. Welles has fallen asleep, slumped low behind the wheel, snoring lightly. Welles awakens with a start, looking around, confused. He calms, rubbing his eyes, wiping sweat from his features. ACROSS THE STREET The quaint house's garage door begins to rise. IN THE CAR Welles sees this, keeps low, watching... The big car backs out into the street. The old woman's behind the wheel, wearing a hat, driving away, alone. Welles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror. ON THE STREET Welles gets out of his car, shuts the door quietly behind him. He starts walking towards the quaint house, looks all directions, making sure no one's around. Ahead, the garage door begins to close. Welles picks up the pace, trying not to look too conspicuous. The garage door's halfway down... Welles runs towards the garage, has to dive and roll to get there, but he makes it under the door just as it closes. ABOVE In ONE WINDOW of the quaint house, an eyeball is peering out from lacy curtains, then moves away and curtains fall shut.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. QUAINT HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles gets up, takes out his gun, brushing off. The garage is dark, full of BOXES and JUNK. Welles moves towards the door to the house.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. QUAINT HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Machine, in T-shirt and jeans, seen only from behind, comes to a DRESSER and opens a bottom drawer. His huge hands push clothing aside, digging deep to the bottom of the drawer, taking out the WRESTLING MASK. Machine stands straight, pulling the mask down over his head.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. BASEMENT -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles enters from the garage, gun up. The dank basement is small. A PILE of LAUNDRY lies on the floor near a WASHING MACHINE. SHEETS hang off several CLOTHES LINES strung across two metal poles. Welles leads with his gun... He moves around the sheets, looking behind them. There's a WOODEN STAIRCASE leading upstairs. Welles starts up, treading lightly, trying not to make a sound...[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. KITCHEN -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles slowly opens the door to the kitchen, pointing his gun. No one here. The decor is feminine, neat and tidy. It's grandma's house, and it shows, with gaudy PRINT WALLPAPER everywhere, every shelf displaying HUMMEL FIGURINES or COLLECTORS PLATES. Very Home Shopping Network.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles slowly opens the swinging door, entering from the kitchen, sweeping the room with his gun. No sign of Machine. The whole house is dead quiet. He passes the dining room TABLE where he watched the old woman eat last night... passes fake PAINTINGS on the walls, of waterfalls and sunset mountain landscapes... moves into the living room area... Yellow shag CARPET. A pink SOFA is covered in clear plastic, facing an old TELEVISION in faux-wooden cabinet. Welles heads for a staircase leading to the second floor. Welles creeps up the stairs...[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles comes up from the stairs, arrives at a closed DOOR. He opens the door. It's a linen closet, with TOWELS and SHEETS on shelves, and a shelf of MEDICINE. Welles shuts the door and moves on. There are TWO DOORS ahead, both closed. Welles takes the one to the right...[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. MACHINE'S BEDROOM -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles pushes the door in, enters warily. There's a constant SCRATCHING HEARD. The room is like a child's, except the BED is huge. Shelves are full of BOARDGAMES and COMIC BOOKS. A DANZIG POSTER on the wall. There's a RECORD PLAYER with LP RECORDS beside it. A record turns on the turntable, the needle caught at the center, SCRATCHING... Welles eases his way over to the closet... reaching... Pulls it open, steps back, gun up. Nothing. Just clothing.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles crosses, opens the door across the hall, enters... DOWN THE HALL, very slowly, Machine's head rises on the stairs, in the garish wrestling mask, peering.[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. GRANDMA'S ROOM -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles stays near the door, looks around. There's a fuzzy sky-blue COMFORTER on the bed, fuzzy blue SLIPPERS nearby. Lots of bottles of MEDICINE on the bedside table. Welles lowers his gun, takes a step back, into the hall...[/ACTION]

[SCENE]INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY[/SCENE]
[ACTION]Welles turns... Machine charges down the hall, screaming with rage, BOWIE KNIFE raised to kill... Welles brings his gun up, but Machine's upon him, stabbing... Welles catches Machine's hand, stops the knife. Machine grips Welles' gun hand, shoving him back... Welles is SLAMMED against the wall, grappling, gun hand pinned. Welles GUN GOES OFF, once... twice... BLOWING HOLES in the ceiling. Machine's grunts, pushing the knife forward... closer to Welles, face... closer... Welles struggles, overpowered. The tip of the horrible knife is inches away... Welles bends his knees, crouching, trying to gain distance from the blade... Machine pulls Welles gun hand lower, brings it against the swinging LAUNDRY CHUTE DOOR built into the wall, begins twisting Welles' hand back, trying to pry the gun loose... Welles looks out the corner of his eyes to his gun... Welles turns his gun hand, slowing struggling to aim the gun towards the knife, but it's awful close to his face... The knife's shaking, less than an inch from Welles' cheek... Welles shuts his eyes and turns his head, letting out a CRY, FIRES his gun... The bullet BLASTS Machine's knife, knocks it away! Machine recoils for a millisecond, but brings his now free hand to Welles' throat, choking him. Welles' face reddens, bleeding from bullet fragments... Welles tries to pry Machine's fingers from his throat. Machine works on Welles' gun hand with violent, renewed effort -- SLAMS Welles' hand against the laundry chute... SLAMS it... SLAMS it... till Welles DROPS the GUN... The gun can be HEARD CLATTERING down the chute. Machine brings his hand to join the other around Welles' throat. Welles can't break the grip... Welles PUNCHES Machine's face, till blood runs out from the mask's nose hole, but it's having no effect... Welles brings his KNEE UP HARD -- into Machine's stomach! Machine falls to his knees with a ROAR, holds his already wounded stomach, bleeding through his shirt... Welles falls, clutching his throat, gasping. He struggles to his feet, leaps past, headlong towards the stairs... Machine rises, charging after... ON THE STAIRCASE Welles is TACKLED from behind... Welles and Machine TUMBLE down the stairs, SMASHING the wooden railing, toppling a BOOKSHELF... LANDING HARD... Welles PUNCHES and KICKS, breaking free, running across the living room. Machine rises to give chase... Welles grabs a dining room CHAIR and THROWS it... Machine knocks the chair aside, keeps coming. Welles grips another chair, uses it to hold Machine off... Machine grips the chair by the legs. Welles SHOVES forward, pushes Machine back, letting go... Welles dives under the dining table, crawling on his hands and knees, scrambling... Machine throws the chair, runs, leaps... Machine lands on the table, crawls to the far edge, GRABBING down with his meaty fists as Welles moves forward... Under the table, Welles jerks back, avoiding, then rises, extending his knees, PUSHING upwards from underneath... Welles FLIPS the table, throwing Machine to the floor... Welles charges towards the kitchen door, falls, gets up... Machine gets to his feet... IN THE KITCHEN Welles SHOVES through the swinging door... Machine BURSTS through, catching Welles, TACKLING him... Welles hits the floor with Machine on top. Machine begins to rein PUNCHES down on Welles, head and back... Welles tries to cover up, taking a real beating... Machine rises, gripping Welles, LIFTING him, THROWS him... Welles SMASHES into shelves of knick-knacks over the kitchen sink, SHATTERING a WINDOW, landing on the sink and counter. Machine comes to grip Welles again, drags him across the counter, KNOCKING EVERYTHING to the floor... Machine SWINGS Welles, releases him... Welles SLAMS the refrigerator and slumps to the ground, tries to stay conscious, trying weakly to get back up... Machine comes to Welles, gets on his knees... Machine wraps his arm around Welles' neck from behind, gets him in a CHOKE HOLD, tightens his grip, cutting off Welles airway with his forearm... Welles tries to break Machine's impossible grip with one hand, begins searching the floor with his other hand... frantically feeling for anything he can use... Welles' face is blood red... Welles' hand grasps desperately... finds a FORK, grips it... Welles SWINGS the fork back, STABS it into Machine's thigh! Machine SCREAMS, releases Welles and falls back, reaching around to the fork... Welles gets to his knees, sucking air, turns to look... Machine crawls away, pulls the fork out with trembling fingers. Beyond him, there's the BASEMENT DOOR. Welles gets to his feet, looking... He grabs a FRYING PAN off the counter, gripping it in both hands and moving towards Machine... Machine's getting up... Welles BASHES Machine in the face with an upward swing of the frying pan... Machine is sent backpedaling, CRASHING into the oven! Welles drops the pan, leaps over Machine, to the door... IN THE BASEMENT Welles comes down the stairs, falls when he gets to the bottom, barely has any strength left. He looks all directions, sees the LAUNDRY CHUTE in the ceiling... Welles gets up, stumbling, falls to his knees at the PILE of dirty LAUNDRY, starts digging through it, searching desperately, throwing clothing aside... Behind, Machine comes down the stairs, a bloody mess... Welles searches the laundry pile... Machine reaches the bottom of the stairs, heading for Welles. Welles turns, has the GUN in hand, FIRES TWICE... HITTING Machine in the shoulder and stomach, knocking Machine a few steps backwards... Welles FIRES... Machine's HIT in the CHEST, falling back, into hanging laundry, pulling down the clothes line and sheets... Machine hits the ground, wrapped in sheets. Welles stands, still aiming the gun, pulls the trigger on an empty chamber. Out of bullets. Machine's trying to pull free from the sheets, trying to get back up to his feet. Welles lets out a sob, drops the gun, walking to Machine... Welles climbs onto Machine from behind, takes clothing line in hand, starts wrapping the cord around Machine's throat... Welles pulls back on the clothes line, pulling it tight... Machine tries to get his fingers around the cord. Welles stands, pulling tighter, putting a foot on Machine's back, pulling the clothes line with all his might... The cord's cutting into Welles' hand, drawing blood. Machine, face down, lets out a gurgling sound, struggling, struggling... till he finally stops moving. Welles releases the cord, takes a step back, breathing hard, trembling. He looks around the basement. Welles walks to pick up his gun, replaces the gun in his holster. He stands looking at Machine. Welles walks to Machine, bends, grasps Machine wrestling mask, pulling it off. He rolls Machine over... Welles stares down at Machine. We never see Machine's face.[/ACTION]
